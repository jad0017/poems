\textbf{Aloof} \\
\\
Conversation shifts so smoothly, \\
but your attention isn't as easy. \\
``Are you listening?'' they ask, \\
but you aren't there. \\
\\
You are standing in a swamp, \\
considered by a trillion porcelin stars. \\
If you squint, just a little, they sparkle--- \\
\hspace*{2ex}freshly cleaned and serene, \\
content distant toilets; \\
glistening in the darkness. \\
\\
You wonder if the swamp is also a toilet \\
as you gloop yourself free from the guck at your feet \\
and notice a lone looking glass within reach. \\
You stare into the glass and a vignette plays out. \\
\\
A lone man stands beneath a flickering steet lamp. \\
Faceless bodies approach, one after another. \\
The man reaches into his jacket \\
and passes each a languid heart. \\
\\
You wonder how many selves had to die to meet this \textit{current's}
	supply. \\
\\
Once the stream dies down, a child approaches. \\
``Hey Mr. Lamppost,'' the child says, \\
``have you wondered if you're where shadows come from?'' \\
\\
The vignette fades, leaving your stone-worn face in frame. \\
``Are you listening?'' it asks, \\
but you aren't there. \\
\\
You are standing on a street corner beneath a lamppost. \\
You are a statue. \\
You have no plaque. \\
You are nameless. \\
You are a statue. \\
The light overhead flickers out. \\
You do not notice. \\
You have no eyes. \\
You are a statue. \\
\\
``Are you listening?'' \\
