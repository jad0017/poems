You've done it\ldots{} You've taken my goals. \\
I'm caught in a landslide like so many souls. \\
Who, left, is there for me to confide? \\
\\
I searched for answers in your face. \\
But all I found was a sullen place \\
filled with guilt and misery. \\
\\
I have lost my best friend, \\
but this pain too will end. \\
\\
I still find myself in old reverie\ldots \\
\\
In your wake, I refuse to drown. \\
