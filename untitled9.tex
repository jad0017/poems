\textbf{Untitled 9} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
Your midnight hours intertwine; lost in harmony, \\
fascinated by the warmth of their reflections \\
through the waves of still reigns shorn of \\
responsibility.  They are shades of former glory \\
and slaves to the epitaph. \\
\\
You chase illusions of mourning specters--- \\
drench the fire in your heart \\
smouldering paradise broken down in \\
time; in this room, lying, trembling \\
on the names of betrayers. \\
\\
You were given the nectar of the Earth yet you \\
wear the wasteland beating dust into your face \\
as life's mirage fades away. \\
\\
You are secluded by the corpreal, \\
you are flowing further from the astral plain. \\ % plain is deliberate
You are flowing further from the passage, \\
open and lonely.  Destruction, cast astray. \\
\\
Your silence is a testament to the thought \\
drizzling tormented glimpses of desire \\
washed into the river of darkness \\
hidden behind your golden shroud. \\
\\
You are falling in dismay. \\
You are falling in dismay, \\
cutting closer to the edge of weariness. \\
Your insides turn to incandesce. \\
Your candled presence melts away;
fat dribbled birth exile to tray
measuring wicks end to bitter flame \\
as the universe moves on \\
and forgets \\
your name. \\
