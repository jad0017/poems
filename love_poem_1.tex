I rolled the stem of my glass \\
between my thumb and forefinger \\
starting from the fragile base, \\
working up to the thicker head--- \\
up and down in smooth furling \\
strokes. \\
\\
I swirled around the warm Cabernet \\
watching rich carmine tears form \\
and fall.  Tears I never had.  Tears \\
I will never have.  Tears I wish I \\
could forget but their memories leave \\
me forgotten. \\
\\
I brought the glass to my face, \\
nuzzling the rim against my nose \\
letting the smooth surface smother \\
my thoughts before indulging in the \\
wine biting bitter hearts into my \\
throat. \\

You were \\
hot milk with a drop of brandy \\
a warmth that burned just right \\
and set my soul to trance. \\
\\
You had \\
stolen the fires of Hades \\
made their rage your own \\
made their heat your own \\
your passion \\
set my ice to thaw \\
for I had none of my own \\
the soulless searching for their soul. \\
% This is a really weak stanza... passion/heat/melting ice are
% very cliche and weaker than the rest of the poem... I really
% wanted to express the
% "I fell in love with your passion for I had none of my own"
% bit but I'm pretty sure it's lost as written.
% Something more concrete would be best to fit with the rest.
\\
You painted \\
scarlet on your arms \\
and smiles on your face \\
all I could do was gentle my eyes--- \\
my heart--- \\
and embrace your imperfections. \\
\\
You deserved to be loved but I didn't know how. \\
\\
Even when drowning dressed you, \\
you managed to dam my streams; \\
we were both ready to burst. \\
\\
And when you told me \\
you belonged to the ocean \\
I couldn't calm your tides \\
anymore. \\
\\
The rocks cried out \\
and broke both our backs \\
on separate shores. \\
\\
You found your continent. \\
I found my island. \\
We were both for the better. \\
