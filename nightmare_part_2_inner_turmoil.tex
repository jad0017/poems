% INTJ if you want Myers Briggs but I find it shifting
% as I grow into something of a cacophony of all the different
% letters attempting to voice their opinions
%
% The biggest struggle loving myself...
% That'd be me and my stupid head.
% Shit gets weird in there.
% It's all agraid to love anythign and it constantly
% finds thigns wrong with other things so it doesn't have to get close to them.
%
% I joke about a lot of shit in poetry but I think the biggest theme
% ends up being like a duality and a duel between the two main
% influential "voices" in my head that I call the scholar and the beast.
% It's like a demon and an angel but they switch sides often because
% either one can be the lesser of my two evils.

%
% But dear, you're an ornament, an accessory to...
%

%
% Voided thought

%
% Fearing the silence, we scream
%

%
% Caterize and atone.
% Unioverse etched into your stone.

% like crows

% Sometimes you try to take pictures of something but they all come
% out blurry, like the person isn't really there at all.

\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{I}} \\
The Scholar sits in front of you. \\
``Quizzle me this,'' it says, \\ % Thanks to R.F. Daniels for this one.
``You dive into the river of Acheron, \\
\ desperately searching for what you've lost \\
\ as the hands try to pull you down. \\
\ But you don't let them take you. \\
\ Instead, you stay suspended mid-boyancy \\
\ in the hazy stillness that surrounds you. \\
\\
\ How long can you survive submerged before drowning?'' \\
\\
Your smile fades and you avert your eyes \\
as the Scholar moves to your right. \\
\\
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{II}} \\
The Beast sits before you. \\
It leans it's snout up to your ear \\
and whispers, ``The answer is `forever'.'' \\
\\
The Beast usurps the Scholar which falls to your left. \\
\\
You are content. \\
You place yourself into a box. \\
You wander the necropolis within. \\
You carve your words into sepulches. \\
You name them monuments. \\
\\
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{III}} \\
The beast leans in once more, \\
\h{}Now vitriolic \\ % Now vitriolic and swollen
\h{}Now swollen \\
its arm around your shoulders. \\
``We are the dead. \\
\ Our existances breathe hollow \\
\ and bare no sweat. \\
\ We are not echos \\
\ and, thus, we will simply \\
\ cease to exist.'' \\
\\
It grins. \\
\\
You are afraid of death. \\
You are afraid of dying alone. \\
You are afraid of loving \\
\h{}yourself. \\
You were not meant to love. \\
You are afraid of emotion. \\
You are afraid of humanity, \\
\h{}yours or otherwise. \\
\\
% IV.
% The scholar: "You are unfinished; defined by ink still welled."
