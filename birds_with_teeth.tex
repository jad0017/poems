\textbf{Birds with Teeth} \\
\\
You're stuck in the water \\
and there are fins \\
all around. \\
\\
You make a break for shore, \\
bashing noses with your ores. \\
\\
It doesn't stop \\
when you reach the land. \\
\\
They raise themselves from the water \\
on long bony claws \\
that scrape at the rocks \\
as they shake themselves off. \\
\\
They unfold their blubberous wings, \\
and take to the skies. \\
\\
Earth's most dangerous predator; \\
the terror of the skies \\
and the seas\ldots \\
Shark-Birds: the fish with wings. \\
\\
With fin and feather \\
they may brave \\
every biome and weather. \\
\\
There's nowhere to run \\
when they catch your scent. \\
\\
Shark-Birds, \\
nature's hunters, \\
always win. \\
\\
Aerodynamic in both the air \\
and the sea. \\
\\
A creature so devastating \\
as to inspire the phrase: \\
\\
\textit{Float like a butterfly.} \\
\textit{Sting like an anemone.} \\
