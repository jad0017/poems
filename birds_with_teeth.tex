\textbf{Birds with Teeth} \\
\\
Trapped in a boat, \\
fins circle around. \\
When they dive \\
from the sky \\
you accept your end. \\
\\
The terror of light \\
and deep blue \\
rip, peck and chew. \\
\\
They can't be stopped. \\
Has science gone too far? \\
\\
Unstoppable forces of nature \\
With fin and feather \\
in every biome and weather. \\
\\
The hunter within: \\
Shark-Birds always win. \\
\\
Aerodynamic in the air \\
and the sea. \\
\\
Float like a butterfly. \\
Sting like an anemone. \\
