You catch a dandelion blinking at you, \\
but wait, \\
dandelions can't blink, \\ % don't blink?
so you investigate. \\
\\
The dandelion just stands there, \\
hunch-backed, hair-teased, \\
on it's tiny patch \\
amidst concrete seas \\
\hspace*{2em}alone, \\
\hspace*{4em}stranded, \\
hoping that wind might coalesce with its seed \\
and stray from the sidewalk to the soil. \\
% that seems so foreign these days. \\
\\
And I am the fool?, you think, \\
as you continue down laid paths. \\
\\
A mile down the road \\
you see another dandelion \\
it smooths back each of its pappus in turn \\
as it turns to face you. \\
"I am a tree" it whispers \\
