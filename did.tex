Evil is never so obvious \\
\h as others may lead you to believe. \\
\\
I first met the devil \\
\h long ago on some winter's eve, \\
\h\ldots{} or was it before \\
\h\ldots{} when the leaves began to fall? \\
\\
Regardless, the encounter was \\
\h\ldots{} a marvelous sight. \\
\\
The jitters I felt \\
\h\ldots{} still keep me well into the night. \\
\\
Beautiful, was she, with lovely brown hair, \\
\h\ldots{} an adorable chin \\
\h\ldots{} endearing eyes \\
\h\ldots{} and a playful grin. \\
\\
She spoke softly with a voice \\
\h that might purify the damned, \\
\h but now I know all she spoke were lies. \\
\\
At the time, all seemed right in the world. \\
\\
Together we visited a garden \\
\h known only to few. \\
\\
A secret haven where \\
\h the blood flowers once grew. \\
\\
The hours were long, but still they fled. \\
So, relaxed, aside a tree, I laid my head. \\
\\
I closed my eyes \\
\h and let the cool breeze envelope me \\
\h in a languid tranquility. \\
\\
\ldots{} and when I awoke, \\
\ldots{} well, \\
\ldots{} I found a knife against my throat. \\
\\
She laughed it off \\
\h with eyes filled with glee. \\

Surely I must have more sense than to stay, \\
\h\ldots{} though at the time, \\
\h I don't know that I cared. \\
\\
I was entranced by that temptress-- \\
\h whose skin was smooth and fair-- \\
\h whose speech was a ballad sung only for me. \\
\\
My heart was caged and she held the key. \\
\\
Again, one day, I'd felt at ease \\
\h as the sun began to set, \\
\h she whispered in my ear \\
\h a serenade to sleep. \\
\\
This time, I awoke with screams \\
\h to a sharp pain deep in my chest \\
\h with my adored smiling over me \\
\h and nails protruding from my barren flesh. \\
\\
The fog had cleared, \\
\h as I cried in agony. \\
\\
That Eldritch whore \\
\h seemed eager to pierce me more. \\
\\
Terrified, I ran to prevent my tragedy. \\
\\
I fled the region, \\
\h for all that I dread \\
\h might someday find \\
\h and wish me dead. \\
