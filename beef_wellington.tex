\textbf{A Poem About Beef Wellington} \\
{\small\textbf{And abosolutely nothing else.}} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{longtable}{l}
Are you aware, that in a true Wellington, \\
the duxelles is mostly dirt? \\
\\
You remind me of a nice plump Wellington. \\
%and I don't mean the dish. \\
The sorry weasels that live in holes; \\
too scared to leave the ground. \\
They cake themselves in mud and muck \\
to keep them from being found. \\
\\
How does it feel to be a little log \\
with your entrails along your back? \\
So easy to pluck and rip your guts \\
as one deveins a shrimp? \\
\\
You are meat. \\
Nothing gives you pulse to rise. \\
You drift in a listless sea. \\
And when the world wakes \\
you do not contend \\
but offer yourself as feed. \\
%You exist for the consumption of others. \\
\\
Why would you saunter \\
out from your home \\
when all that exists is there? \\
Your contention is a trap and \\
your comfort a snare. \\
\\
How does it feel to be so alone? \\
Knowing there's no one to care? \\
Your stagnation is gracious \\
but its design is heinous--- \\
you could die if you tripped on the stairs. \\
\\
And just like the Wellington, \\
you're a dying old breed \\
delicious with bread and cheese. \\

%To not sense the change in the air? \\
%Your stagnation is gracious for it hasn't \\
%let you in on the plan. \\
%\\
%But the heat wave is coming \\
%and my tummy's rumbling. \\
%So let's get the show on the road! \\
%Dress yourself in buttery dough \\
%and in the oven you go. \\
%As just like the Welly, \\
%you're a dying old breed \\
%better with bread than cheese. \\

%I know what you're thinking, but \\
%\h{}\h{}beef Wellington \\
%\h{}actually\h{}exists. \\
%\\
%Or at least the Wellington \\
%was not always beef. \\
%\\
%The Wellington was a weasel \\
%with its entrails exposed; \\
%a perfect log of meat and fat \\
%ripe to be rolled in dough. \\
%\\
%This weasel, you see, was a menace \\
%of sorts, always burrowing into the ground. \\
%The old old Duke had had enough \\
%and held a hound-wound hunt.
%\\
%And thus a creature once abound \\
%is now nowhere to be found. \\
