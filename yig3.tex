\\
Oh misery awaits \\
       me again \\
\\
Bound through the ancients \\
   this tome of dust-covered sleep-- \\
\\
Though haunted and cursed-- \\
    my curiosity was piqued. \\
\\
What laid beyond that \\
    golden clasp \\
in crumbling pages \\
    suffocated by patinated leather? \\
\\
Oh the whispers were strong. \\
\\
``Where the spinner in darkness \\
haunts the abyss, \\
drink from my chalice--- \\
a dark-red kiss.'' \\
\\
But I did not dare; never dare. \\
\\
Haunted and cursed--- \\
   my oddity lay. \\
\\
What fires felled you \\
in that store room surrounded \\
by dunes of beige and brown? \\
\\
Oh the rotten disease \\
  of time---forgotten. \\
\\
``Deep in the woods where the widows prey, \\
five candles are set upon a floor of clay. \\
Shadows are cast upon the pentacle star. \\
where the madness will speak: \\
\textit{Kaal'm tha'lu yig-d'gar} \\ % call oom thay loo yig de garr
\textit{e' haathu im-perluum}.'' \\ % ee hath oo imm pear loom
\\
But I did not dare; never dare. \\
\\
When the eight-legged herald found me. \\
\\
never dare. \\
when the woods broke from living. \\
\\
Nor when the living flame danced among waxen forms. \\
\\
never dare. \\
did I speak for the silence' gyration spoke enough. \\
\\
Hastur. \\ % Haas-taur
\\
``From the sea it comes, but it whispers not. \\
Fire billows from the cold of flesh. \\
Two moons set the tides to rise. \\
Whispers go and unspeak becomes \\
where the yellow robe culls it sign. \\
\\
Innominandum'' \\ % In nom ee nan dum (should be innominate)
\\
Oh when the pillars errupted from the Earth \\
when the tombs of fire decended \\

``For a single thread wisps awry \\
and untangles the world.'' \\
