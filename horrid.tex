\textbf{Horrid Murder and the Bad Duchy} \\
\\
Fluttered wakes by astral tides \\
``I feel so light'', \\
revelled my mind. \\
\\
But abberation befell \\
and washed hope away. \\
\\
Embittered by stance \\
I let my heart recount\ldots{} \\
\\
Plague befell my kind\ldots{} \\
\\
We used to be free, \\
but our will was destroyed. \\
The silver leaked out\ldots{} \\
I was only a boy. \\
\\
Sanctuary never came. \\
The crown was to blame! \\
\\
The sun sauntered down \\
where the battle was waged \\
\\
Hundreds had fought. \\
Hundreds were slain! \\
\\
``We'll fucking die tonight \\ % From cattle decapitation
and that's perfectly all right\ldots{} \\
We'll fucking die tonight \\
and that's perfectly all right with me\ldots{}'' \\
\\
Every stone writhed and turned. \\
The Earth had shown me life \\
She plucked each star from the sky \\
and kissed my cheek goodnight. \\
\\
I fluttered in wakes on astral tides \\
but a queston ignited and brought me back. \\
\\
``My concious persists\ldots{} am I not alive?'' \\
But the echoes were waning on darkening skies. \\
