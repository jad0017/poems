\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{My Nothing Interlude}} \\ \hline
\\
I remix pools---one hunnid---I'm all nob. \\
Two Sinner Gods playin' Rockstar Theory out \\
With Paris in the middle catchin' city lights. \\
\\
My whole problem's confidential; \\
Bitchin' up the Three-O-Five. \\
\\
I'm up in rap: Young Aston---Mr. Dem. \\
Erasin' serenades. Twice State. \\
Drawin' dots on my dramma. Girl. \\
\\
Are you wild like this numb wish? \\
Wavin' money; ladies gettin' rich. \\
\\
You in love with that Carlton? \\
Bound and wicked. Like a flower, huh? \\
\\
I got a hunnid 'n' two. \\
Pushin' lights on my boutique, \\
Just hopin' to catch you. \\
\\
You're a flower in the makin'? \\
Killin off my Rockstar Theory \\
And shellin' for daddy. \\
Like a Widow Worker, \\
At my Feelin' Bank? \\
\\
But you're a hearless cat--- \\
A loveless ball of wicked. \\
\\
I best pass. \\
Get my power back \\
Got a promis to my self \\
That I wont dip and bare \\
The Bad Bitch Remix \\
Always playin' in my ear. \\
