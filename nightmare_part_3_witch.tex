% I didn't really know where I was going with the "My Mind is a Nightmare"
% series until I drafted this piece.  I believe that, while the pieces are
% all very disconnected, the series shows a growth in my life from depression
% into something all together different.  There is a final piece for the set
% planned after this one and I hope the completion is everything I thought it
% could and would be.

I was always told to never cross a witch, \\
but no one told me to never love one either. \\
\\
% Middle bits; need meeting up with appearance, young, but dishevaled
% This is the goat witch and that needs to be presented.

She was dumping out a pungent green liquid \\ % Maybe poignant instead?
that gurgled as it filled a freshly dug pit. \\
\h ``What's that?'' I asked. \\
``Souls,'' she replied, ``dirty, rotten souls. \\
Always fouling up the place.'' \\
\h ``And now fouling the Earth?'' \\
``And now to be cleansed and returned to the dirt.'' \\
% Originally I wanted the aforementioned souls to be a state of depression,
% the sad thoughts of the nearby villagers, however, I wasn't sure how to
% phrase it and instead it now appears to be a form of evil.  I'm okay with
% the change but I feel that it may overall weaken the piece from the original
% intent of having the goat witch take on the suffering of the people.
\\
She drew a soft silver liquid from her hand. \\
As her breathing slowed and her eyes relaxed, \\
she whispered against the wind. \\
She poured out her soul; \\
shaking every last drop from the pail, \\
carefully, so as to avoid breaking \\
the rust-worn structure. \\
\\

% There's definitely a cadence to the above selection.  Here as a song sung by
% the witch.  I originally had a different version that was to be used earlier
% in the piece but then dropped it.  The purpose was to contrast how the people
% think of the witch's work with what the witch actually does.  The above
% version being the witch's which shows a positivity and her strive to make the
% world a better place at the cost of her self.

She turned toward me, \\
the shadows casting her smile wry, \\
that I knew to be genuine. \\
\\
\\ % Pt 2
I was always told that I would feel love one day, \\
but no one told me that butterflies appear in pairs. \\
\\
The first is weak, \\
a gentle hum nursing from a bud. \\
It tests its wings, gaining strength, \\
until it is ready for flight. \\
\\
The second, erratic; clipped wings \\
pumping harder to stay aloft. \\
Its flight is chaos, \\
inflamining imperfections, \\
turning my heart poignant. \\
