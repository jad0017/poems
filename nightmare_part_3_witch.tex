% I didn't really know where I was going with the "My Mind is a Nightmare"
% series until I drafted this piece.  I believe that, while the pieces are
% all very disconnected, the series shows a growth in my life from depression
% into something all together different.  There is a final piece for the set
% planned after this one and I hope the completion is everything I thought it
% could and would be.

\begin{longtable}{c}
\textbf{I.} \\
I was always told to never cross a witch, \\
but no one told me to never love one either. \\
\\
\textit{Lost in the woods at night,} \\
\textit{strange trees line the way;} \\
\textit{nauseating.} \\
\textit{As they claw at your frame} \\
\textit{a hut appears} \\
\textit{caked in mud, silt, and loam} \\
\textit{in a clearing} \\
\textit{where flowers cease to desist.} \\
\\
\textit{Their beauty draws you in.} \\
\textit{Lunacy of a red moon's light} \\
\textit{assailed by bats and bones} \\
\textit{you enter the Nekromant's home} \\
\textit{and partake of the cretin's stew.} \\
\\
\textit{Three sips;} \\
\textit{you taste the snake's tounge.} \\
\textit{Valerian death fills your lungs} \\
\textit{and then you sleep.} \\
\\
\textit{All the while,} \\
\textit{the witch returns} \\
\textit{for her turn to eat.} \\
\\
% Middle bits; need meeting up with appearance, young, but dishevaled
% This is the goat witch and that needs to be presented.
As it turns out, there was a shack in the woods \\
with long-worn walls, roughly maintained, \\
amidst a garve-laiden garden; \\
each stone, nameless but not aimless. \\
They were meticulously placed North-bound headings \\
and their keeper: pale, wearing ``disheveled'' \\
as if it were ``perfectly put together''. \\
\\
When I first met the witch \\
she was dumping out a pungent green liquid \\
that gurgled as it filled a freshly dug pit. \\
\\
``What's that?'' I asked. \\
\\
``Souls,'' she replied, ``dirty, rotten souls. \\
Always fouling up the place.'' \\
\\
``And now fouling the Earth?'' \\
\\
``And now to be cleansed and returned to the dirt.'' \\
% Originally I wanted the aforementioned souls to be a state of depression,
% the sad thoughts of the nearby villagers, however, I wasn't sure how to
% phrase it and instead it now appears to be a form of evil.  I'm okay with
% the change but I feel that it may overall weaken the piece from the original
% intent of having the goat witch take on the suffering of the people.
\\
She drew a soft silver liquid from her hand \\
into a nearby bucket. \\
As her breathing slowed and her eyes relaxed, \\
she whispered against the wind. \\
She lifted the bucket and poured out her soul; \\
shaking every last drop from the pail, \\
carefully, so as to avoid breaking \\
the rust-worn structure. \\
\\
``Out in the woods \\
when the moon grows pale \\
the witch can be found \\
casting her spells \\
by spirit's fire \\
with a stone-worn veil \\
for the world to prosper \\
and it's evil quelled.'' \\
% There's definitely a cadence to the above selection.  Here as a song sung by
% the witch.  I originally had a different version that was to be used earlier
% in the piece but then dropped it.  The purpose was to contrast how the people
% think of the witch's work with what the witch actually does.  The above
% version being the witch's which shows a positivity and her strive to make the
% world a better place at the cost of her self.
\\
She turned toward me, \\
the shadows casting her smile wry, \\
that I knew, at that time, to be genuine. \\
\\
\textbf{II.} \\ % Pt. 2 y'all
I was always told that I would feel love one day, \\
but no one told me that butterflies appear in pairs. \\
\\
The first is weak, \\
a gentle hum nursing from a bud. \\
It tests its wings, gaining strength, \\
until it is ready for flight. \\
\\
\textit{Strigarum. Heretic.} \\ % Stry-gare-um
\\textit{Sulpher tinctured in blood,} \\
\textit{the witch's kiss.} \\
\textit{Sanguinary bliss,} \\
\textit{a murky wine} \\
\textit{evil's your tounge} \\
\textit{with her lies.} \\
\\
``A caged beast causes no harm, eh? \\
Clearly you've never heard one speak.'' \\
Said the witch, ``If I placed you in that cage \\
over there, would you you not lash out? \\
Curse me? Plead to me? Offer yourself in service \\
for dignity?'' \\
\\
\textit{Strigarum. Sorcerer.} \\
\textit{Lust-befallen recourse} \\
\textit{for the one who turned you Faustus.} \\
\textit{In dusk we ride,} \\
\textit{torches high} \\
\textit{lighting the cross.} \\
\\
``It's simply their way. Here in the forest \\
we are not bound to societal ideals, \\
but they, as always, seek to emulate the cruelty \\
of their fore-bearers as if it is something \\
to be proud of.'' \\
\\
\textit{Sacrosanct, now apostate.} \\
\textit{The witch will die} \\
\textit{and the birds chirp} \\
\textit{upon the dawn} \\
\textit{while her body rests} \\
\textit{in ashes.} \\
\\
``They would rather our flock be caged, controlled, \\
with bound beaks; afraid of our soliloquies.'' \\
\\
\textbf{III.} \\ % Pt. 3 is short and sweet
The second butterfly, erratic; clipped wings \\
pumping harder to stay aloft. \\
Its flight is chaos, \\
inflamining imperfections, \\
turning my heart poignant. \\
