\\
This dragon was once in love. \\
\\
I saw her grazing \\
\h and pooping everywhere--- \\
\\
A majestic unicorn \\
\h with baby blue hair. \\
\\
Her mane was fluffy; \\
\h it made my heart pound \\
\h and the air all stuffy. \\
\\
One day she caught me staring. \\
\\
I panicked and screamed! \\
\h ``I love you!'' \\
\\
The air froze \\
\h and my heart skipped a beat \\
\h when she opened her mouth \\
\h and snapped, \\
\h ``I'm not a tooth fairy. \\
\h\ I will not suffer fools. \\
\h\ What does a fat dragon \\
\h\ like you know about \\
\h\ letting a unicorn trot first?'' \\
\\
My spirit was crushed \\
\h and my wings turned to lead. \\
\\
She galloped off \\
\h and left me behind. \\
But I just couldn't get her \\
\h thought out of my head: \\

\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
\textit{Legs for days} \\
\h\textit{and a tail that\ldots{} just\ldots{}} \\
\h\textit{sways and sways.} \\
\\
I saw her again a month later. \\
\\
She was prancing all around \\
\h leaving little hoof prints on the ground. \\
\\
So I puffed up my chest \\
\h until my cheeks turned blue \\
\h and I strolled over \\
\h with my head held high. \\
\\
``Let me cut to the chase, '' \\
\h I said without any tact nor grace, \\
``I want \textit{taco} on a date with you.'' \\
\\
``You call that an approach?'' \\
\ she scoffed, \\
``Don't make me laugh. \\
\ You're just gross. \\
\ You'll never get me. \\
\ You'll always fail; \\
\ especially with\ldots{} uh\ldots{} \\
\ that \textit{small} of a tail.'' \\
\\
I stood there speechless as she sauntered off. \\
\h\textit{Is my tail really too small?} \\
\h\textit{Is Natural Tail Enhancement really the way to go?} \\
\\
I was caught in a hoof \\
as another victim \\
of the Bad Pony Club. \\
