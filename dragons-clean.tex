\\
This dragon was once in love. \\
\\
I saw her grazing \\
and pooping everywhere--- \\
\\
A majestic unicorn \\
with baby blue hair. \\
\\
Her mane was fluffy; \\
it made my heart pound \\
and the air all stuffy. \\
\\
One day she caught me staring. \\
%\\
I panicked and screamed! \\
\h``I love you!'' \\
\\
The air froze \\
and my heart skipped a beat \\
when she opened her mouth \\
and snapped, \\
\h``I'm not a tooth fairy. \\
\h I will not suffer fools. \\
\h What does a fat dragon \\
\h like you know about \\
\h letting a unicorn trot first?'' \\
\\
My spirit was crushed \\
and my wings turned to lead. \\
\\
She galloped off \\
and left me behind. \\
But I just couldn't get her \\
thought out of my head: \\

\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
\textit{Legs for days} \\
\textit{and a tail that\ldots{} just\ldots{}} \\
\textit{sways and sways.} \\
\\
I saw her again a month later. \\
\\
She was prancing all around \\
leaving little hoof prints on the ground. \\
\\
So I puffed up my chest \\
until my cheeks turned blue \\
and I strolled over \\
with my head held high. \\
\\
\h``Let me cut to the chase, '' \\
I said without any tact nor grace, \\
\h``I want \textit{taco} on a date with you.'' \\
\\
\h``You call that an approach?'' \\
she scoffed, \\
\h``Don't make me laugh. \\
\h You're just gross. \\
\h You'll never get me. \\
\h You'll always fail; \\
\h especially with\ldots{} uh\ldots{} \\
\h that \textit{small} of a tail.'' \\
\\
I stood there speechless as she sauntered off. \\
\textit{Is my tail really too small?} \\
\textit{Is Natural Tail Enhancement really the way to go?} \\
\\
\textit{Oh no!}
\\
I was caught in a hoof \\
as another victim \\
of the Bad Pony Club. \\
