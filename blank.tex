\\
You go about your day, \\
doing everything the same, \\
but while you're talking \\
your mind goes blank \\
and your lungs forget to breath \\
and you can barely register your heart beating. \\
\\
You aren't even sure if it's real \\
or if that periodic feeling in your chest \\
is just another dull sound your ears are perceiving. \\
\\
And then your lungs remember to breath \\
and your eyes remember to track \\
and the sound all comes rushing back. \\
\\
And you just pick up where you left off \\
hoping no one noticed the pause, \\
the lack of expression, \\
and the glossed over eyes. \\
\\
But they do. \\
\\
Because the pause was a little too long \\
and your expression was of pain \\
and your eyes weren't glossy, \\
they were struggling to roll up into your skull. \\
\\
They always ask, ``are you okay?'' \\
It's clear that you can't say yes\ldots{} \\
\\
Can't they just let it go? \\
\\
There's no cure except to sleep \\
and telling you so won't make it come any easier. \\
\\
There's too much pain. \\
There's too much emptyness \\
when, every day, just for a few moments, \\
you forget that you're alive. \\
