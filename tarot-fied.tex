\textbf{Tarot-fied} \\
\\
Hops with vinegar \\
Apple with core \\
I sung to the pot \\
And stirred it more. \\

Ginger root and gangala too \\
Nestled next to \\
An old leather shoe. \\
\\
Almond oil and lemon weed \\
Into the pot \\
I stirred with glee. \\
\\
Until bubbles broke the surface. \\ % broke the air.
\\
Until the aromas crawled from their homes \\
and cracked the shell that reality held. \\
\\
Until they slithered across time and spoke \\
life into themselves before the first wave \\
of implosions shattered the void and \\
sprung all manner of matter to form. \\
\\
Until \\
they replaced \\
the air \\
in my lungs. \\
\\
A click. \\
A chime. \\
Broke my rhythm. \\
I sighed. \\
\\
``Hello\ldots'' came a voice.
A vice to violate my calm.
It came with a presence \\
that shook--- \\
annoyed \\
like an orange \\
allergic \\
to its rind. \\
\\
A click came again. \\
My time to shine. \\
\\
I tore aside \\
the violet divider \\
and entered the room \\
where the presence loomed. \\
\\
I laid three decks upon the table. \\
\\
The Lion \\
The Dragon \\
The Fawn \\
\\
``And which is that?'' It gestered toward the door. \\
``I want the best.`` The presences swore. \\
\\
The Chimera had chosen a host. \\
\\
Six cards.
The cross was formed. \\
\\
``The you.  The presence which sits before me.'' \\
\\
``The bumps and hurdles along your road.'' \\
\\
``The carrot.  Your desire.'' \\
\\
``What darkness holds behind closet doors.'' \\
\\
``The light that was made yours.'' \\
\\
``Tomorrow.  Next week.  The near future you will meet.'' \\
\\
Four more \\
For the staff to hold. \\
\\
``An arrow drawn to fire.  A vector for you to follow.'' \\
\\
``What fate allows you to know.'' \\
\\
``Your hopes.  Your fears.'' \\
\\
``What may come.  One future for you to find.  To hold or toss aside.'' \\
\\
The presence smirked. \\
Death (XIII). \\
Lay before me. \\
Reversed. \\
% So Death (XIII) is more about killing off the complications in life
% and bringing yourself back to the bare minimums in life---the necesities.
% So when it is found in reverse the card means the opposite.  That one must
% attach more to their lives.  This imagery is important since the "presence"
% mentioned in this poem is suppose to be Donald Trump.  This is, of course,
% completely lost to the reader and thus the point of this poem will not be
% apparent for them.  This indicates that some rework is necessary to
% accomodate those without that knowledge.
