\textbf{Untitled 6} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
I split myself in half, \\
holding my worst outside; \\
my own Brothers Grimm \\
and myself, Disneyfied. \\
\\
Three shots of tequila, \\
with a whiskey to chase. \\
But these feelings weren't waning. \\
I tried to stop drinking at eight \\
before my incisions cut deeper \\
while screaming abate. \\
\\
Hard lines in my hand, \\
growing knuckle to thumb; \\
fingers pointing at me, \\
at my internal scum. \\
But I could hear my thoughts \\
thumping honeyed spite \\
and humdrum, as I smiled away \\
what I could become
while the could haves \\
and should haves \\
where cocking their guns. \\
\\

\begin{tabular}{l}
I split myself in half, \\
holding my worst outside; \\
turning tears into beers; \\
letting sleeping dogs lie. \\
But now that I'm home \\
I can look up to the sky \\
and take in the air \\
letting out a big sigh. \\
The past is the past, \\
not a harbringer this time. \\
It's a grim little tale \\
that's told with a rhyme \\
about a little boy \\
who stayed on his trail; \\
never straying for want; \\
never lifting the veil; \\
but somewhere inside \\
he was fighting his gale. \\
\\
The wind died out with him \\
when his path reached the tide. \\
He had nowhere to go. \\
He never learned how to swim. \\
He couldn't trek back in time; \\
take that fork to the left; \\
He couldn't make other choices, \\
but regret was regret, \\
so he kept walking, \\
toe-heeled, \\
straight through the sea \\
where the ferry was waiting \\
and his heart was free.
