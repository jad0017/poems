\textbf{Untitled 6} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
I split myself in half, \\
holding my worst outside; \\
my own Brother's Grimm \\
and myself, Disneyfied \\
\\
By drinking and drinking. \\
Three shots of tequila, \\
with a whiskey to chase. \\
But my feelings weren't waning\dots \\
I tried to stop drinking at eight \\
before my incisions cut deeper. \\
But the hours poured on \\
\\
Hard lines in my hand, \\
growing knuckle to thumb; \\
fingers pointing at me; \\
at my internal scum. \\
I could hear my thoughts thumping \\
honeyed-spite to monotonous tunes \\
as I smiled away all that I could become \\
while the could haves \\
and should haves \\
where loading their guns. \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{l}
I split myself in half, \\
holding my worst outside; \\
drinking away all my tears; \\
letting sleeping dogs lie. \\
The past is the past, \\
not a harbringer.  This time \\
It is a grim little tale \\
that's told with a rhyme \\
about a little boy \\
who stayed on his trail; \\
never straying for want; \\
never lifting the veil. \\
Meanwhile inside \\
he was fighting his gale. \\
\\
The wind died out with him \\
when his path reached the tide. \\
He had nowhere to go; \\
He couldn't trek back in time. \\
He couldn't make other choices; \\
take that path to the left. \\
Regret will always be regret. \\
So he kept on walking, \\
toe-heeled, \\
straight through the sea \\
where the ferry was waiting \\
and his heart could be free. \\
\\
I split myself in half, \\
holding my worst outside. \\
I'm not embracing my past. \\
I'm just\ldots \\
failing to say\ldots \\
goodbye. \\
