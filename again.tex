Again I found you---packet \\
of soy sauce on my desk. \\
Your salty blackness staring \\
me dead in the face while \\
your oil seeps into the lacquer. \\
\\
For a moment I think we are the same. \\
\\
% I know I'm not being silly.
% I know what I do.
I roll on top of others until \\
my oil finds its way into \\
their hearts. I congeal \\
the red in their veins \\
until their blood can \\
no longer breath. I \\
am the blackness others \\
find sitting on \\
their desks \\
at their works \\
and in their homes\ldots{} \\
\\
The moment passes. \\
\\
I wipe you away. \\
You're our of sight. \\
But you're still inside \\
me.
