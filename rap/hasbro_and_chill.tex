\textbf{Hornopoly (Hasbro and Chill)} \\
\vs
First day; I was passin' \\ % One day
the Bal-tic Avenue \\
when I saw your pretty face \\
over in Light Blue. \\
I thought I'd take a walk \\
and say ``hi'' to you \\
when the Reading came by \\
and blocked my view. \\
\vs
I took a big leap; \\
landed on a chance. \\
Heart beatin' fast, \\
just by happenstance. \\
Missed my mark \\
in the dark. \\
When the double-R cleared, \\
you were anywhere, \\
everywhere but here. \\
\vs
(chorus: \\
  I was never really made \\
  sippin' Life's lemonaid. \\
  I was born to the Board--- \\
  my umbillical cord.) \\
\vs
It's been a few years \\
and I've got' a little older \\
(but) that Hasbro sticker \\
is still on my folder. \\ % shoulder \\
I crossed the double-R \\
but I wandered too far \\
and found myself sittin' \\
behind a few bars. \\
\vs
I left the iron life \\
(and) fell into some luck \\
these snake-eyes landed \\
me with a few bucks \\
when I saw your eyes again \\
over the Ken-tuck' \\
so I took a step up \\
``Girl, hey, what's up?'' \\ % And offered you a cup
%(and said "let's fuck") \\
\vs
(chorus: \\
  I was never really made \\
  sippin' Life's lemonaid. \\
  I was born to the Board--- \\
  my umbillical cord.) \\
\vs
%(chorus: \\
%I been dreamin' of that face, \\
%Those legs, that waist \\
%But I'm standin' on the rails \\
%No houses; No hotels) \\
%With no one to embrace) \\
%No houses; no hotels \\
%Can't keep outta the cells \\
%Can't keep off of the rails \\
%I'm standin' on the rails \\
%All due to these shells. \\ % (shell game)
%
%I took a big leap \\
%landed on a chance \\
%just by happenstance \\
%ain't no way to 'vance \\ % advance
%when I caught a little bug \\
%and I fell into a rut \\
%on a journey 'cross these streets \\
%for your digit-deets. \\
%
%Bank error e'ry day. \\
%Thing goin' my way. \\
%Two bills in the tank. \\
%Got the B.O., not stank. \\
%\vs
%You lookin' real fine \\
%in your cannon. How's mine? \\
%I'm a steam boat, baby; \\
%on this land, I ride. \\
%I know you lookin' \\
%at that Park Place. \\
%But my Boardwalk sittin' here \\
%screamin' your name. \\
%\vs
%I got a hunnid fifty bills, \\
%four houses, and wheels \\
%which a whole lotta steam \\
%that need(s) pipes to fill. \\
%\vs
%Inherit all this money \\
%got stocks to sell \\
%cuz the rent is poppin' \\
%like these rhymes are droppin' \\
%\vs
%Round and round \\
%on this board--- \\
%I got snake eyes. \\
%(I got snake eyes) \\
%\vs
%Round and round \\
%on this board--- \\
%I got snake eyes. \\
%(I got snake eyes) \\
%\vs
%Woah \\
%gotta cool my jets \\
%another double-set \\
%I go straight to jail \\
%I'll be trouble-set \\
%\vs
%\vs
%And she say \\
%``Ain't no free parkin', babe. \\
%You gotta pay your way.'' \\
%\vs
%So I whipped out a stack \\
%with Water Works on top \\
%and she rode my Short Line \\
%to the railroad stop. \\
% until the Income Tax was dropped. \\
%\vs
%Woah \\
%``(I) thought you better than that.'' \\
%Nah girl, that just Uncle Jack. \\
%\vs
%E'ry Pennybag has to pay his share \\
%to the American Flag that law foreal \\
