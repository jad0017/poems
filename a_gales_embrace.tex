\textbf{A Gale's Embrace} \\
\\
One night \\
I made myself small. \\
I shrunk to a pea \\
and fell through the cracks \\
into the world beneath \\
where the ether ached of words. \\
\\
I envied the silence, \\
as I laid among those echoes. \\
\\
That night \\
I let them all in. \\
I fought my mind, \\
executing each belief \\
%(and)
mourning what they had been. \\
\\
That disease felt like freedom-- \\
my catharsis-- \\
but the cysts on my skull \\
only spilled the words that entombed me. \\ % s/spilled/leaked/?
\\
That night \\
I gave up my heavens-- \\
the light beyond fathom-- \\
for the frenzy of frail minds-- \\
the sweet rot beneath the floors-- \\
\\
As I let \\
my flesh strip away \\
until only hopelessness \\
remained. \\
