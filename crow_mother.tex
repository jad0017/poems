Shadows streched \\
and formed around me \\
until I could not see \\
but felt the concrete beneath my feet \\
and walls within reach. \\
\\
suddenly \\
\h{}a veiled opalescense \\
\h\h{}approached me \\
stark and unadorned \\
\h{}grey skin \\
\h\h{}black opaled eyes \\
\h\h\h{}radiating light \\
\h{}it took my head \\
\h\h{}in its hands \\
playfully \\
\h{}stroked my cheek \\
turned \\
\h{}and begged me to creep \\
\h\h{}after \\
\h{}knowing it was me \\
\h\h{}a perfect expression \\
\h\h\h{}of disjoint identity \\
\h\h{}a guise \\
\h{}stripped of the skin \\
I clung so \\
\h{}desperately \\
I tripped along \\
\h{}for what seemed hours \\
\h\h{}quickly left behind \\
following tinnitus signs \\
\h{}alive \\
\h\h{}only in mind \\
\\
Without a guide, \\
I miss-stepped in the dark. \\
My feet met an edge, \\
but I responded too late. \\
The greeting was over \\
and that fall my fate. \\
