\textbf{Fallen Leaves} \\
\\
Your iron shroud showed them Hell. \\
You met the haze \\
(frosook the grave) \\
to wallow in the dark \\
and beg the mire for Fall's elegy. \\
\\
The cold cut your search;
grace left you blind \\
and to believe \\
that you will, one day, see the sky. \\
\\
Fear faltered and drowned you, yet \\
you found a friend. \\
\\
A rope---your salvation\ldots{} \\
but it stretched too thin. \\
\\
No afflicted mercy awaited you. \\
Your tears salted your lips. \\
\\
They bred your lust for holiness. \\
They birthed your unrelention. \\
\\
You saught the crown \\
\hspace*{2ex}made of throns \\
\hspace*{4ex}and promissed to remove your horns. \\
Still, \\
\hspace*{2ex}the dark, \\
\hspace*{4ex}the ice, \\
\hspace*{6ex}the mist, \\
\hspace*{8ex}and the snow, \\
made sure that you \\
would finally go. \\
\\
You found escape to redemption at last \\
But you could not run from your past. \\
\\
The ethereal\hspace*{4ex}took you to judge\ldots \\
The ethereal\hspace*{4ex}ruled your darkness\ldots \\
The ethereal\hspace*{4ex}showed you light\ldots \\
and laughed as you petrified. \\
\\
The dead---fallen leaves\ldots \\
Your iron shroud showed them Hell \\
and your body was broken \\
as the ethereal judged your deeds \\
and showed you hell\ldots \\
\\
just as you showed those leaves. \\
