\textbf{The Island} \\
\\
They say if you hold a conch to you ear, \\
you can hear the ocean. \\
I've never needed a conch. \\
All I hear day in---day out \\
behind the dull static \\
are waves crashing on the shores \\
of a tiny island littered \\
with age-old debris. \\
\\
A beast lives on the lisand. \\
He is as big as a buffalo \\
with matted purple fur, deep blue eyes, \\
and five yellow horns. \\
\\
He tells me about the world. \\
About the people\ldots\ who they really are. \\
\\
``Everyone, everything, would rather see you die.'' \\
He always ways before returning to the brush. \\
\\
His claws leave gashes in the landscape \\
which only weather with time. \\
But there he will be again\ldots \\
with something new to tell me. \\
