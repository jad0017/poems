\textbf{Alone with a Shark} \\
\\
Of all the stupid fish in the sea, \\
\h{}it's those which swim through my door \\
that are the worst: \\
\\
\h{}The blue-scaled worker \\
\h\h{}who needs a rock as big as a whale\ldots \\
\\
\h{}The school-fish \\
\h\h{}who has a severe addition to Coral Drops\ldots \\
\\
\h{}The executive eel \\
\h\h{}who lost a while reef to the shell game\ldots \\
\\
They're all the same. \\
\h{}\textit{Poor peniless slobs} \\
who can't seem to float upstream. \\
\\
But, there is always that one who is the lowest of the low. \\
\h{}The \textit{Cr{\'e}m{\'e} de P{\"u}-P{\"u}}\ldots \\
\\
Today, that lucky \textit{bass}-turd \\
\h{}is Jeffery ``Fishy Fins'' Gwend{\"a}ga. \\
Three weeks late on his payment. \\
\\
Ol' Fishy Fins runs a sweat shop \\ % wet shop?
\h{}out by the seahorse tracks. \\

He's been known to bet smart and win hard, \\
\h{}but this time, \\
the sand-d slipped right out of his small \\
\h{}oily fins into those of the biggest Don \\ % Don fish type?
this side of the Triangle. \\
\\
I found Jeffery packing a fresh shipment of his fins. \\
\\
Now Jeffery is a Catfish with integrety, \\
\h{}and really long barbels. \\
He might employ many a snook or pollock \\
\h{}for well under minimum wage \\
and force them to work long hours in a cave darker than \\
\h{}the Mariana Trench, but he always insists on packing \\
the product himself. \\
\\
``There's just something so gratifying about a pair of well-folded fin socks,'' \\
\h{}he always says. \\
\\
He has a real \textit{tail}or spirit, \\
\h{}but he was also a few thousand Arena Dinero short \\ % Ah-rain-uh Dee-nare-oh
from seeing me. \\
