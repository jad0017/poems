\textbf{Alone with a Shark} \\
\\
Of all the stupid fish in the sea, \\
\h{}it's those which swim through my door \\
that are the worst: \\
\\
\h{}The blue-scaled worker \\
\h\h{}who needs a rock as big as a whale\ldots \\
\\
\h{}The school-fish \\
\h\h{}who has a severe addition to Coral Drops\ldots \\
\\
\h{}The executive eel \\
\h\h{}who lost a whole reef to the shell game\ldots \\
\\
They're all the same. \\
\h{}\textit{Poor penniless slobs} \\
who can't seem to get afloat. \\
\\
But, there's always that one who is the lowest of the low. \\
%\h{}The \textit{Cr{\`e}me de Chum}\ldots \\ % Cr{\`e}me de la k{\'e}ta
\\                                          % krem day la kay-ta
Today, that lucky \textit{bass}-turd \\
\h{}is Jeffery ``Fishy Fins'' Gwend{\"a}ga. \\
Three weeks late on his payment. \\
\\
Ol' Fishy Fins runs a sweat shop \\ % wet shop?
out by the seahorse tracks. \\

He's been known to bet smart and win hard, \\
but this time, \\
the sand-d slipped right out of his small \\
oily fins into those of the biggest Don \\ % Don fish type?
this side of the Triangle. \\
\\
I found Jeffery at work packing a fresh shipment of his fins. \\
\\
Now Jeffery is a Catfish with integrity. \\
He might employ many a snook or pollock \\
for well under minimum wage \\
and force them to work long hours in a cave darker than \\
the Mariana Trench, but he always insists on packing \\
the product himself. \\
\\
``There's just something so gratifying about a pair of well-folded fin socks,'' \\
\h\h{}he always says. \\
\\
He has a real \textit{tail}or spirit, \\
but today, he is a few thousand Arena Dinero short \\ % Ah-rain-uh Dee-nare-oh
from having to see my smiling face. \\

I swam around the ray-docking entrance a few times \\
before confronting Jeffery. \\
\\
``Nice place you got here, Fishy. \\
Got that real industrial feel. \\
Say, how's business been lately?'' \\
\h\h{}I said as I began circling him again. \\
\\
``Socks are socks,'' \\
\h\h{}he replied, \\
``Not much change there.'' \\
\\
``Stability is a good thing,'' \\
\h\h{}I mused, \\
``Well, things on my end aren't so swimmy. \\
See I've got this oily fellow trying to give me the slip \\
on his payment.  It's the type of thing that makes me \\
real bottom-fed.'' \\
\\
I flashed him a toothy grin \\
as I slid a long knobby chunk of coral out from bag. \\
\\
Fishy Fins tried to flee, \\
but you just can't out-swim a shark. \\
\\
I rounded about the shelves to block his path out from the warehouse. \\
\\
``You wouldn't want to do something regretful, \\
now would you Fishy? You're a respectable fellow, \\
right?'' \\
\\
Jeffery slowly backed away. \\
\\
``I-I-I can get your sand-d. I swear. \\
I-I just don't have it right now.'' \\
\\
``Fishy, Fishy, Fishy. \\
I trust you, alright, but I'm gonna need a little\ldots{} \\
insurance.'' \\
\\
I rotated my body a full 90 degrees and twisted my head back \\
with the coral bat tightly clenched between my three-rows of teeth. \\
\\
I brought the bat down as fast as water-resistance would allow \\
letting the coral strike Fishy down the side of his fin \\
ripping off a small chunk of bone and webbing. \\
\\
``Friday.'' \\
\h\h{}I said, smashing a box of folded fin socks on my way out. \\
\end{tabular}\\
\begin{tabular}{l}
I propped my bat by the door, swam to my desk, \\
and carefully dialed in the combination to the safe underneath. \\
\\
``Don't worry, \\
I'll be bringing you more friends soon.'' \\
\h\h{}I whispered as I watched the dollars scurry about and hide under the sand. \\
\\
I closed the door, propped my tail up onto my desk, \\
and blew a puff from a freshly lit cigar. \\
\\
``It really is a shark-eat-all world these days.'' \\
