\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{My Nothing Interlude}} \\ \hline
\\
I remix pools---one hunnid---I'm all nob. \\
Two Sinner Gods playin' Rockstar Theory out \\
With Paris in the middle catchin' city lights. \\
\\
My whole problem's confidential; \\
Bitchin' up the Three-O-Five. \\
\\
I'm up in rap: Young Aston---Mr. Dem. \\
Erasin' serenades. Twice State. \\
Drawin' dots on my dramma. Girl. \\
\\
Are you wild like this numb wish? \\
Wavin' money; ladies gettin' rich. \\
\\
You in love with that Carlton? \\
Bound and wicked. Like a flower, huh? \\
\\
I got a hunnid 'n' two. \\
Pushin' lights on my boutique, \\
Just hopin' to catch you. \\
\\
You're a flower in the makin'? \\
Killin off my Rockstar Theory \\
And shellin' for daddy. \\
Like a Widow Worker, \\
At my Feelin' Bank? \\
\\
But you're a hearless cat--- \\
A loveless ball of wicked. \\
\\
I best pass. \\
Get my power back \\
Got a promis to my self \\
That I wont dip and bare \\
the Bad Bitch Remix \\
always playin' in my ear. \\

\\
Whisper beyond your defiance. \\
Interweave---entangle---that weeping \\
Horizon in which you see \\
The cold morphine drip---embodied and waterless. \\
\\
Everywhere is unburdened, \\
But no calm fields call it home. \\
\\
That bow, you draw back \\
In revulsion---into painless, \\
Slumbering, tombs. \\ % painless, slumbering, tombs read slowly.
\\
You rend that which guides your eyes to sleep. \\
You are haunted, somehow, consumed by hours \\
that crack and smoulder each September. \\
\\
And everything. Every. Last. Piece of debris. \\
Won't let you go. \\
Won't let you tear the night's veins \\
Left behind by the bounded ghosts of mornings \\
That hiss by faster than the Earth \\
Dsperately setting into eternity. \\

\\
Behind the tide, \\
Through the Ancients, \\
You found today \\
To be almost withered \\
While the blue erases \\
Me. \\
\\
The desert soul, \\
Where your emotions morn \\
What the tounge laid \\
Into the newborn divide, \\
Search--sleepless--for \\
calumnies. \\
\\
Victory through words. \\
Conquer, ablaze with \\
Adoration but summon coldness \\
Everywhere you turn. \\
You are wedded downward; \\
Ever-held to roam \\
by the suit you killed. \\
\\
You collapsed one day. \\
In the Summer, \\
You held, somehow, the pain. \\
But you came undone \\
As the cross came greater. \\
Your concious tracked weary in shame. \\
And you carried the strife that blisted your veins \\
Until the end--- \\
Unto your grave.

\\
Fragile and outnumbered, \\
Your iron shroud showed them Hell. \\
But to you, \\
You met the haze. \\
You forsook the grave \\
To wallow in the dark \\
And beg the mire for Fall's elegy. \\
The cold cut your search. \\
But grace left you blind \\
And to believe \\
That you'll one day see the sky. \\
Softly--It's already your fault--- \\
Aches the ethereal in devastation. \\
In rope, by circumstance, you found \\
an ill-shaped friend. \\
Fear faltered and drowned you. But, \\
There was a catch. \\
Your friend wished to show you rapture--- \\
Your salvation. \\
But it stretched too thin; \\
No afflicted mercy awaited you. \\
Unresolute---your tears---
Salted your lips. \\
Yet they bred your lust for holiness. \\
They birthed your unrelention. \\
You found the crown \\
Made from thorns \\
And promised \\
As you bled \\
To remove your horns. \\
Still, the dark, \\
the ice, \\
the mist, \\
and the snow, \\
made sure that \\
you would finally go. \\
You, who collected tounges. \\
You, draconian and misanthropic, \\
Found escape to redemption at last, \\
But could not run from your radiant \\
blood-filled past. \\
The ethereal took you to judge. \\
The ethereal ruled your blackness. \\
The ethereal showed you light. \\
The ethereal laughed as you petrified. \\
Fragile and outnumbered, \\
Your iron shroud showed them Hell. \\
And for each of those bloodied leaves \\
Your body was broken \\
As the ethereal judged your deeds \\
And showed you Hell \\
Just as you showed those leaves.\\
