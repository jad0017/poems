\textbf{Untitled 7} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
There is a garden \\
where my feelings go \\
and the midnight crows \\
on twisted branches \\
praising the moon. \\
\\
Each perch bares a noose \\
for lungs beating \\
bufferfly wisps slipping \\
through grays of bobbing \\
headds and morning bags \\
too tried to hold themselves \\
up so they let rotten digits \\
bare their weight and both \\
bodies break; bark before bone. \\
\\
Missing days \\
Missing nights \\
Where is my life? \\
\\
The dawn breaks overhead \\
and the garden fades. \\
% behind windowpanes. \\
% \\
% The latex masks \\
% come out again \\
% permanent crows \\
% walking tears away \\
% drawn bows \\
% firing to the sun \\
% praying arrows won't come down \\
% and pin this smile into frown \\
% \\
% \textit{Then he walked away\ldots} \\
