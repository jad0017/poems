\\
You go about your day, \\
doing everything the same, \\
but while you're talking \\
your mind goes blank. \\
Your lungs forget to breath. \\
You can barely register your heart beating. \\
\\
You aren't even sure if it's real \\
or if that periodic feeling in your chest \\
is just another dull sound your ears are perceiving. \\
%is just another dull sound your ears are reporting \\
%and your mind perceiving as touch \\
\\
Then your lungs remember to breath. \\
and your eyes remember to track \\
and the sound all comes rushing back. \\
\\
And you just pick up where you left off \\
hoping that no one noticed the pause\ldots{} \\
The lack of expression\ldots{} \\
The glossed over eyes\ldots{} \\
\\
But they do. \\
\\
Because the pause was a little too long \\
and your expression was full of pain \\
and your eyes weren't glossy, \\
they were struggling to roll up into your skull. \\
\\
And they always ask, ``are you okay?'' \\
It's clear that you can't say yes\ldots{} \\
\\
Can't they just let it go? \\
\\
There's no cure except to sleep \\
and telling you so won't make it come any easier. \\
\\
There's just too much pain. \\
Too much emptiness \\
when, every day, \\
even if just for a few moments, \\
you forget that you're alive. \\

Tomorrow \\
You will go about your day \\
Doing everything the same \\
But while you are talking \\
Your eyes will glaze \\
And you will struggle to remain standing \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
They will say ``You look like death'' \\
As you remember that you are afraid \\
Of zombies, pale and icy \\
Brain-dead \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
They will ask ``Are you okay?'' \\
And you will shrug it off \\
``Late night'' \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
They will say ``You should sleep'' \\
As your mind goes blank \\
As your lungs forget to breathe \\
As you barely register your heart's beat \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
You won't be sure your pulse really exists \\
The periodic feeling in your chest \\
Will become another dull sound \\
Your ears mis-perceive \\
And your mind misinterprets as touch \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
Your lungs will remember to breathe \\
Your eyes will remember to track \\
And the sound will all come rushing back \\
You will pick up were you left off \\
As if nothing happened \\
As if you're okay \\
\\

\\
Tomorrow \\
They will notice the pause \\
They will notice the blank expression \\
They will not be fooled \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
You will develop a stutter \\
That lasts for years \\
Your eloquence will become a past \\
That only you remember \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
You will forget your childhood \\
Your parents will dissent \\
And worry that they too \\
Will be forgotten \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
You will regret leaving your bed \\
You will regret leaving your house \\
You will regret your existence \\
\\
Tomorrow \\
You will forget that you are alive \\
You will forget that you are not a zombie \\
Pale and icy \\
Brain-dead \\
\\
\textit{Just thinkin' about} \\
\textit{Tomorrow} \\
\textit{Clears away the cobwebs} \\
\textit{And the sorrow} \\
\textit{'Till there's none} \\
