\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Fate}} \\ \hline
\\
These eyes were once removed from malace. \\
In time they learned--alongside deceit. \\
Enthralled before by blackened silk \\
hapiness became bereft of me. \\
\\
Sundered by lust \\
of sociopathic play, \\
an endless mourning of purgated promise \\
putrified and devoured \\
by incantatory edge, \\
\\
Brazened, now, in shame of phantom transparency, \\
languid in virtue \\
enshrouded in grim rememberance \\
of azure landscapes \\
veiled in the pale moon's glow. \\
\\
Implacable, I've become, \\
consumed by warm memory, \\
set ablaze by beguiled ivory, \\
fervent in pursuit \\
of incandescent seas, \\
slowed only by brackish somnolence \\
entombing this monstrosity \\
of besotted dread. \\
\\
Tormented with irremediable unrest, \\
this dissonant vortex \\
of brocaded lucidity, \\
bodes to wither me \\
to listless delirium, \\
incappable to escape my eternal bed. \\
