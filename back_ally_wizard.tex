\begin{tabular}{l}
Deep in the Shambles \\
where light cannot penetrace, \\
the collective of magic \\
lines the alleyway \\
to sway the stray passersby. \\
\\
In the darkest corner \\
dressed by the brittle \\
and painted with brandy \\
is the man we call \textit{The Wizard}. \\
\\
Gather around children; \\
hear my tale. \\
\\
Surrounded by these dead beats \\
with elder signs \\
as you squable on streets \\
looking for real magic \\
but find baubles in droves. \\
\\
You ask for gold \\
and potions like \\
we are alchemical gods \\
but love finds water weak \\
and scorching bones know well \\
the lust for gilt-luxery. \\
\\
You thirst for the arcane \\
but the arcana wants \\
nothing of you.  Power \\
comes at cost making \\
business troublesome \\
so I'll tell you a secret \\
real magic is a fantasy. \\
\\
Hard work and careful thought \\
breed better than two-bit \\
string binding locust wings. \\
\\
Hang you daftness on pillars \\
(not) seeking for answers \\
for issues you've gathered \\
and let fall to indignation \\
stay lost to the waking \\
but remember \\
you may defy the moon. \\
