\textbf{Totes Ma Goats} \\
\\
Five lights: \\
a chevron in my eyes. \\
Silver rings descend. \\
\\
Two horns \\
amidst the floating rings \\
on a head adorned \\
by hair and ribs. \\
\\
The yellow bone\ldots \\
asymmetric in their holes\ldots \\
a spiraled left\ldots \\
a broken right\ldots \\
\\
Knocking gums curdle in the night. \\
``We want your goats!'' \\
\\
My bones crack. \\
I feel my abdomen exposed \\
and hooves on my legs. \\
\\
``We want your goats!'' \\
The head insists, \\
rattling my drums \\
as the others jaunt, \\
surrounding us. \\
\\
``Baaaaa!  You've no goats to give!''
\\
Five tails \\
float by my eyes. \\
Silver rings ascend \\
snuffing out the light. \\
\\
``We want all goats!'' \\
Echoes across the sky. \\
Fields burn as they fly. \\
\\
Goatmagedon is here\ldots \\
Totes how we die. \\
