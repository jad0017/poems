\textbf{I.} \\
\\
I found you in the nothingness \\
\h{}Broken and beaten and scarred. \\
\hh{}With thorns about your soul. \\
%\hh{}The thorns about your soul \\
%\hhh{}Left you fragile, weak, and jarred. \\
\\
I took you in my arms--- \\
\h{}Tearing my flesh from bone--- \\
\hh{}To welcome you to darkness; \\
\hhh{}The place I call my home. \\
\\
\textbf{II.} \\
\\
You took me in your arms, \\
\h{}Adorning yourself with lies. \\
\hh{}You welcomed me to darkness; \\
\hhh{}That place between your thighs. \\
\\
You found me in the nothingness--- \\
\h{}Another heart for you to take--- \\
\hh{}But all I have is emptiness; \\
\hhh{}This heart of mine is fake. \\
\\
\textbf{III.} \\
\\
You fed me with your madness. \\
\h{}You let me trust your voice. \\
\hh{}You tried to take my heart; \\
\hhh{}In your blood, I rejoice. \\
\\
I stabbed you into nothingness. \\
\h{}I sundered you from bone. \\
\hh{}I ate your sullied flesh. \\
\hhh{}Now I'm all alone. \\
