\textbf{The Autumn Masquerade} \\
\\
Earth removes her feathered hat-- \\
slowly; undressing the landscape until \\
all falls barren. \\
\\
Vibrance gone; air, cold and stale, \\
trembling the womb that birthed \\
the trees, the corn, and the leaves. \\
\\
Sixteen times I saw this scene \\
and the beauty exposed-- \\
her frightened limbs shaking-- \\
\\
%While every morn' in her wake \\
%I place this face to seperate me \\
While every morn' by fault of despair \\
I don this face to separate me \\
from her dying body. \\
