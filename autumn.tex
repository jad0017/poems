\\
Earth removes her feathered hat-- \\
slowly; undressing the landscape until \\
all falls barren. \\
\\
Vibrance gone, \\
trembling the womb that birthed \\
the trees, the corn, and the leaves. \\
\\
Sixteen times the leaves had turned \\
and the beauty exposed. \\
\\
Sixteen times I saw that scene. \\
Sixteen times forced to remember \\
the stricken face of \\
her dying body. \\

\textbf{The Autumn Masquerade 2} \\
\\
The Earth remopves her feathered hat. Slowly \\
Revealing the landsacpes until \\
All falls baren. \\
\\
Her arms tremble and shake in Winter's Gale \\
Then her limbs ignite and engulf the fields \\
Of man. \\
\\
Another flower burns\ldots{} \\
But she cannot look away. \\
The mil-dread stones of castles were cast \\
From heights to the cobbled paths. \\
\\
Each fracture stabed and flayed her flesh \\
Each time the tyrants fought. \\
For days and days their armies stood \\
In courtyards of blood and death. \\
\\
And another flower burns\ldots{} \\
But she cannot look away. \\
Her lungs were filled with coal and lead \\
But still they packed away more shot. \\
\\
Each bullet hailed \\
Each trench dug \\
Cut her to the bone \\
\\
And another flower burns\ldots{} \\
But she cannot look away. \\
Bombs rained down as boils of blood \\
From planes high overhead. \\
\\
Each impact she took tore her muscles apart. \\
Each time countries waged. \\
