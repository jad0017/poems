\textbf{The Autumn Masquerade} \\
\\
Earth removes her feathered hat-- \\
slowly; undressing the landscape until \\
all falls barren. \\
\\
Vibrance gone, \\
trembling the womb that birthed \\
the trees, the corn, and the leaves. \\
\\
Sixteen times the leaves had turned \\
and the beauty exposed. \\
\\
Sixteen times I saw that scene. \\
Sixteen times forced to remember \\
the stricken face of \\
her dying body. \\
