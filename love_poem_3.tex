You're the fucking Bellatua \\
and I'm caught in your web. \\
You can hold me, suck me dry, \\
then leave me for dead. \\
You're the Lilith of my dreams \\
and a freak in the bed\ldots \\
\\
Or, at least, that's my assumption \\
since we've never spoken. \\
\\
Because every time you are near \\
my ears get really red \\
and my blood flows up into my ears \\
so I put my hands up to my ears \\
like a personal hand warmer. \\
\\
Because your scent is \textit{Wet Dreams} \\
and the brand is \textit{All Day} \\
and, uh, I wanna buy a vowel\ldots \\
and that vowel is ``U''\ldots \\
a dinner. \\
\\
But not like \textit{buy} you \\
like prostitution. \\
But I guess when you get right down to it \\
the exchange of food for your time \\
is kinda like prostitution. \\
But I'm not trying to buy you so \\
we could separately buy dinner \\
and eat it next to one another\ldots \\
hopefully at the same time and table, \\
heh.
