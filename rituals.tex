\textbf{Rituals} \\
\\
Brooding clouds set upon the early morning sky \\
a lethargic breath of hideous Autumn. \\
Sleepless, again, I find myself here. \\
A very singular existence, \\
affront a very singular cafe. \\
%\\
%Seven to twenty, the only break taken \\
%Away from the melancholy monotony of work. \\
%With long awaited click and familiar jingle, \\
%I transform--unfurling the smile \\
%that might bring pedestrian to pleasure. \\
\\
The scenery never changes; \\
Rustic and monochromatic brown. \\
Faded tables and floors, \\
Faded chairs and rails, \\
A weary landscape distorting time. \\
\\
% The miserable chugging unnerving the silence \\
% Comes from an ancient roaster \\
% relentlessly burning Arabica baens. \\
% An ancient roaster relentlessly burning \\
In the corner, \\
An ancient roaster relentlessly burns \\
Arabica beans--a miserable chugging \\
that unnerves the silence. \\
Someday the owner will quell that suffering-- \\
% Installing something much less... alive. \\
\\
% Embedding the path more distinctly on the floor, \\
I stand where I've stood many before, \\
and speak what I've spoken all too often. \\
An exchange made over the still-clean counter, \\
for the voluptuous blend of Sumatran and Guatemalan, \\
the barista refers, only to, as "Black Velvet," \\
and I, a corporeal delight. \\
