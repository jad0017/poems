\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
We are lost to the era \\
with the zeitgeist upon us. \\
%It holds out its hand \\ % It offers its hands
It offers its crop \\
to feed our cowardice. \\
\\
We are sentenced to strife \\
on our bewildered voyage \\
across this age \\
of paramount fear. \\
\\
We are callow and paralyzed \\
in the face of our landscapes \\
grown to crumble \\
with this Earth's passage. \\
\\
We are ghosts with callous tithes, \\
\textit{awakened by the empyrean}, \\
and rapt by gathered eyes. \\
\\
We did not realize \\
the conversion that arose. \\
\\
We did not realize \\
where the morrow had blown. \\ %meh
\\
We did not realize. \\
We forgot to atone. \\
