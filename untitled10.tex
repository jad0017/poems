\begin{tabular}{l}
Staring into the twilight, \\
the call of insanity can be found. \\
Found as black and as white \\
as the eternal sound \\
of the etheral whisper \\
calling out to the unknown. \\
\\
The whisper calls \\
for that which it seeks. \\
But it neither recalls \\
what it is to find \\
nor speaks \\
to any one mind. \\
\\
Insisiting upon searching \\
for happiness or mirth \\
it forgets the hour \\
and embraces the now. \\
