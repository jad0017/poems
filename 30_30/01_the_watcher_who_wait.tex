\textbf{The Watchers Who Wait} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
The watchers wait aside their windows, \\
pulling close whispering white cloaks. \\
They are dressed with wakes of waning souls \\
that leave their bodies unsettlingly cold. \\
Their expressions are timid with ice in their hues \\
despite the callow weathering of their words \\
and the hellfire they exude. \\
\\
As such the watchers wait aside their windows, \\
  in rooms of blue orchids, \\
watching a world cloaked in wormwood \\
  bloom with white asphodels; \\
bemused by how easily it might light. \\
