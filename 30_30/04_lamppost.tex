It is dusk; \\
a wasteland of crickets and cantankerous silence. \\

It was the fourth time you woke \\
when you needed a walk to calm your heart. \\

You have never experienced panic before \\
but you are sure that this must be similar. \\
\\
You are tired, \\
  wondering if the world would quake any less despite you. \\
You are tired, \\
  wondering if everything will still be alright despite you. \\
You are tired, \\
  wondering if everyone will still live despite you. \\
\\
You are a fixture \\
with your face illuminated by your phone's backlight--- \\
  in this purgatorium. \\
\\
\textit{Hey Mr. Lamppost, do you ever wonder if you're where shadows come from?} \\
\\
You are a lamppost \\
  as your phone's screen fades out. \\
You are a lamppost \\
  as you realize you can no longer move on.
You are a lamppost \\
  as your mind can think of nothing but asphodels. \\
