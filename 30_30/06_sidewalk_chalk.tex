\textbf{06 - Sidewalk Chalk} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l} 
Today there was chalk writing on the sidewalks. \\
I found it ironic that my walk began with \\
``Find joy in the journey'' \\
as the path has become tired; \\
a litany of feet on pavement \\
and the same damn scenery. \\
\\
``Make every moment count! Faith over fear'', % make each moment matter?
the sidewalk continued. \\
Does the fact that I read this upside-down \\
also invert the meaning? \\
Should I squander each moment \\ % squander each second?
and fade into nihilism? \\
Because that's what I've already been doing. \\
\\
Next came a triplicate, each three feet apart: \\
``Be beautiful'' \\
``Be strong'' \\
``Be you'', but the ``O'' was a smiley face. \\
At this point, I began to question the sidewalk's sanity. \\
How can I be both ``beautiful'' and ``strong'' \\
while also being me? \\
Or was this a mutually exclusive selection? \\
If so, I'd prefer to be beautiful, weak, and fulfilled. \\
\\
The sidewalk did have something I agreed with though. \\
A single word, far away from all the others, \\
just doing its best in isolation: \\ %in the face of solitude:
``courage.''
