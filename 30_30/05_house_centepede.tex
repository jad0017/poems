\begin{tabular}{l} 
These days, \\
I liken myself to the wriggly little one-inch eyebrows that live with me. \\
\\
We stay in one place, \\
perfectly still, \\
for hours on end \\
until frightened. \\
\\
We scurry speedily for short stints, \\
then freeze momentarily to catch our breaths. \\
I call this our slow stampede, \\
continuing the same circuits \\
\textit{eternally} \\
until we stop. \\
\textit{eternally} \\
\\
I wonder if, one day, it'll look like someone \\
did some real living here; \\
that our stampede left grooves in the wood \\
and butt prints on all the chairs; \\
enough for someone to look things over \\
and say ``they made good use of this space.'' \\
