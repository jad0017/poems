\textbf{02 - 40 Death Knells From Sunday} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
A mask of ivory besets their face, \\
a chilling remnant unfit before a pulpit. \\
They are no longer gendered nor classed, \\
now a prop in acquiescence, \\
but soon that reluctance shall also pass. \\
Their vacancy reduces to a single thrum \\
as tears flood rivers each Tuesday \\ % The firmament, The second day of creation
and life adjusts to new irrigation. \\
\\
We are still 40 knells from Sunday, \\
but what becomes from this onset apathy? \\
\end{tabular}
