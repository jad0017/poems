\textbf{I Dreamt of Death}\\\\
\begin{tabular}{l}
Years ago, \\
On All Hallows Eve, \\
I met the Devil \\
And she met me. \\
\\
She stood \\
by the bar; \\
watched the drunks stumble \\
and fall. \\
\\
Her eyes drew me in. \\
\\
Half through the night \\
we found ourselves \\
alone \\
(where) that silver queen \\
observed the localities \\
of my dreams. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
I sat in a tent. \\
The eld' hag \\
held the glass. \\
\\
Within (held) the carmine \\
she urged (for) me to drink. \\
\\
I passed into darkness \\
where the light bobbed and grew. \\
\\
Skin as gray as soot, \\
lips as cracked as stone, \\
eyes as black as ebony wood. \\
\\
Doleful--the creature looked \\
and dawned \\
that it was me and I was he. \\
\\
The fungi squelched as we wandered \\
distances diluted by the dark. \\
\\
The light wisped out \\
while my feet met a ledge. \\
\\
I responded too late. \\
The greeting was over \\
and the fall my fate. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
Day broke into serenity \\
upon the garden \\
where the blood flowers grew. \\
\\
The witch fed me her words \\
and led me to sleep \\
by the trunk \\
of the whorl-ed tree. \\
\\
My mind lay at peace \\
enveloped by the breeze. \\
\\
I awoke in pain; \\
her hands around my neck. \\
I screamed and thrashed. \\
The harp' released without a fight. \\
%The harp' released and did not \\
%fight back. \\
\\
She pleaded \\
and pleaded \\
for me to forgive\ldots{} \\
\\
her tone never sweeter \\
led my position to falter; \\
I forgave and cursed my heart. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
The mansion laid \\
deep in the woods--- \\
Immaculate, mosaiced, \\
a brown pimple upon the snow. \\
\\
The woman stood high \\
and adorned \\
the stairwell rails. \\
\\
Vermilion, ornate, \\
the pentacle star \\
obscured the floor. \\
\\
Soft violet (lips) \\
spelled prayer \\
overlooked by idols \\
carved in wood. (alt: of wood) \\
\\
The Bishop rose \\
and devoured another life. \\
%\\
%The pimple burst into flames \\
%and sent splinters into the Earth. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
Dread caged me \\
in the solemn hours of night. \\
\\
Such a frail girl. \\
What had I to fear? \\
Her silken blond hair? \\
Her feathered complexion? \\
\\
My mind drifted and lost my body \\
which found itself outside her door. \\
\\
It brought her home; \\
enslaved to the succubus. \\
\\
Again, \\
the night felt perfect; \\
A surreal escape from \\
my morbid stupidity. \\
\\
I drifted off; \\
my stamina drained. \\
\\
It might have been the nails \\
driven into my exposed abdomen \\
or it might have been the sadistic \\
titillation on her face, \\
but I finally suspected foul-play. \\
\\
The bitch was thrown \\
as I winced. \\
\\
I ordered her to go \\
and she followed \\
with suspicious obedience, \\
\\
But the nails concerned me more, \\
than the smirk upon that whore. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
The phosphorescent floor \\
emblazoned me in white. \\
I fell and landed \\
amidst that haze of light. \\
\\
Above me stood a dragon \\
toking gray from its snout. \\
\\
It sung to me in slow, \\
melodic, \\
breaths. \h\textit{(meh)}\\
\\
The marbled floors burst open; \\
stone teeth closed around me. \\
\\
The floor blinded me again with white. \\
It dulled and left me on the docks, \\
by a boat and (full) crew. \\
\\
They left me on the island \\
where she waited with a pike. \\
\\
She took me by the hand \\
and led me across the land \\
to find the three-leafed tree, \\
the wayward ostrich \\
and the graveyard of flees. \\
\\
I brandished the pike \\
and laid it into the dirt \\
where the fingered tree pointed--- \\
where the ostrich once sat--- \\
where the bodies of the flees lay \\
countless---encrusting the Earth. \\
\\
I broke through the ground \\
no further to go \\
I could see the light \\
my home shown below. \\
\\
A sharp pain erupted from my back. \\
She grunted and pulled and struck me again \\
again and again with a cleave through my skull. \\
I slumped---I had dug my grave. \\
%and fell into that hole. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
Uncaged, \\
Dread left me mesmerized \\
and Mephistopheles rang \\
\\
\textit{For this is Hell, nor am I out of it} \\
\\
I wondered how I may raise such demons, \\
---commit such evils of body and of soul \\
---deluged with such hostility towards fellow man \\
\\
I reasoned that \\
I must take that fiend's sullied heart \\
or remain ensnarled. \\
\\
I took her once more \\
to the garden \\
where few dare to go \\
\\
She held that stupid grin. \\
Always grinning. \\
Always scheming. \\
\\
I greeted her \\
as we ascended \\
through the trees. \\
\\
My mind grew hazy \\
(with) each step further \\
we took. \\
\\
The bloodflowers bloomed \\
and raised praise to Thanatos.\\
They welcomed the demon--- \\
(my) antagonist--- \\
to caress their new-found eyes. \\
\\
She grinned while they whispered \\
and unfurled towards the moon. \\
\\
They glared as I latched onto her neck; \\
again, she did not fight back. \\
She just continued to grin. \\
\\
Those eyes \\
never left \\
my own. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
--- --- \\
Just another Sunday Afternoon \\
on the Island of La Grande Jatte (la grahnd zhahatt) \\
where the faceless looked upon the crystal pond--- \\
\\
Faceless \\
and unique; \\
the tranquil \\
absorbed me. (unencumbered?) \\
\\
The sky opened \\
and bled into the world. \\
\\
The faceless ran. \\
They died around me. \\
\\
I stood and watched \\
while the hooded seized (control). \\
\\
I collapsed \\
when the bank \\
had cleared. \\
\\
Four steps \\
strode \\
across the hollow \\
portrait (air?). \\
\\
Familiar taunts--- \\
\textit{you cannot run from fate}--- \\
produced a click \\
which knocked prostrate \\
where my soul ran into the lake. \\
\end{tabular} \\

By my hands\ldots{} \\
\\
That day, \\
the Devil died\ldots{} \\
and so did I. \\
