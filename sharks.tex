\textbf{Fish Food} \\
\\
I emplore you, \\
ladies and gentlemen, \\
to heed my warnings. \\
\\
Fish are food. \\
Not friends. \\
Never friends. \\
\\
I learned this truth \\
when I was a much younger shark\ldots{} \\
She was a salty piece of bass named \\
Delila Gwendibelle. \\
\\
We met as I was casually bombarding \\
a school of fish just outside the \\
Kingman Reef. \\ % Reef in the North Pacific Ocean, has sharks.
\\
Just before I bit \\
her scales caught my eye. \\
\\
Oh, she wore her scales better \\
than any other\ldots{} \\
\\
I shifted my fearsome face \\
into the politest of smiles \\
as I looked her in the eye. \\
\\
``Heelllooooo, \\
What's a pretty little thing like you \\
doing this far from the bay?'' \\
\\
I knew her response just as soon \\
as I saw her lower mouth push open \\
just slightly enough for three \\
beautiful bubbles of air to \\
escape from her hollow body. \\
\\
``Oh, you know... \\
Just gowing with the flow.'' \\
she said in a sultry low gurgle \\
of shifting waters. \\
