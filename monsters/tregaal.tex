\textbf{Tr{\"e}gaal Descending} \\
\\
Beware the Tr{\"e}gaal--- \\
Tiny little malboids \\
No bigger than a mite, \\
Doused in hair, \\
And covered with tendrilites. \\
They land on your ear, \\
Extend their little legs, \\
And crawl inside. \\
The Tr{\"e}gaal own us. \\
They enslave our minds; \\
%Bastard parasites. \\
They plunge their teeth \\
Into our frontal-lobes. \\
They jack the network \\
And wiggle our toes \\
As a test for what's to come \\
And the power they hold \\
Over these five foot fleshy \\
Human Drones. \\
\\
Beware the Tr{\"e}gaal. \\
Know what you see. \\
%<symptoms>

% Rewrite the ending... maybe a part two
% after humans have been taken over?
%Tr{\"e}gaal descending! \\
%Free your minds. \\
%Regain your control \\
%Or they'll leave you blind. \\
