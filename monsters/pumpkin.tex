\begin{tabular}{l}
``Dance and be merry!'' cried the crier. \\
And all the little ones garbed as pumpkins \\
danced and were merry, as instructed; \\
always as instructed. And, inevitably, \\
when morning rose, the village \\
had decreased in population and \\
had one more pumpkin, carved, at its gates, \\
staring blankly into the bog as protection. \\
\\
Of course, to understand this strange ritual \\
we must rewind the clock to the village's founding \\
and examine the strange symbiotic relationship \\
between the village and the large pumpkin at its heart. \\
\\
Back when the founder first found himself entrenched \\
in the bog, entranced by a low gurgle, he had a thought. \\
\h \textit{I'll erect some platforms here and there} \\
\h \textit{and make this marsh my homestead.} \\
So he left the marsh to gather supplies, \\
not noticing the long silver string, now, attached to his spine \\
nor that the bog now sported a very large set of eyes. \\
