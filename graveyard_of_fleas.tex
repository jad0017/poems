\\
This is the field where fleas come to die. \\
\\
They come and I catch them. \\
I tie them up there-- \\
there with the ropes and the shackles. \\
\\
I pluck off their legs--one by one-- \\
into perfect symmetry. \\
\\
I slice their backs right down the middle \\
and peel aside the lateral flaps. \\
\\
So slowly\ldots{} \\
So carefully\ldots{} \\
\\
I wouldn't want to tear them. \\
\\
I clear out the insides-- \\
get those bits out of the way. \\
\\
I stuff the shells all full of corn \\
and sew them up tight. \\
\textit{Stitchy-stitch-stitch} \\
\\
I dress them in green \\
and straighten their ties. \\
\\
I line them there--one by one-- \\
in neat little rows \\
all in a maze. \\
\\
It's almost ready; \\
Just three more days. \\
\\
I'll open up shop \\
to lure more children \\ % to catch new children
for the next grand attraction \\ % for the next attraction
in my graveyard of fleas. \\
