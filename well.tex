\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Well of Despair}} \\ \hline
\\
Black--everything--black. \\
To the concrete beneath my feet \\
To these walls-- \\
These claustrophobic walls build upon lies. \\
And then that hourglass-- \\
that silver hourglass \\
on which the demons dance \\
and the sand falls red. \\
\\
That eld' hag--she put me here. \\
Why, obediently, did I partake \\
Of that cretin's stew? \\
\\
A light--there's a light in here-- \\
Closer and closer--peering in front \\
Of decaying skin and ebony eyes. \\
Crouching, disheveled and doleful. \\
Staring--just staring at me. \\
\\
We are one; it and I. \\
We differ by skin and of cloth, \\
But our bones are one \\
and out eyes speak the same. \\
\\
Turning it hobbles. \\
I follow close. \\
The fungi covering the cavity \\
Squelch each step I take. \\
\\
On and on it hobbles, \\
Further and further, \\
Faster than I, \\
Until it turns out of sight. \\
The light is a distant memory, but still-- \\
Still I continue in the black. \\
\\
I miss-step in the dark. \\
My feet meet an edge. \\
\\
With my senses dulled \\
I respond too late. \\
\\
The greeting is over \\
and this fall my fate. \\
