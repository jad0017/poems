Signals were lost in the dark mist \\
condeming me to a loop of \\
fettered anxiety wound around tracks \\
that laid limbless and cold. \\
\\
But as day approached night \\
the metal folded and twisted \\
compounding resolutions \\
of cordite constructions \\
of man \\
held in silent fixation \\
as light barrelled forth. \\
\\
The train struck iron and \\
timbered to its side \\
where ashen groves \\
raised from the marred steel \\
and the dead uprooted their cars, \\
laying trails with their veins. \\ % vines?
\\
\hspace*{4ex}\textit{The green never seemed} \\
\hspace*{4ex}\textit{so inviting before\ldots} \\
\\
I wandered that path \\
to its end where a house \\
sat in a clearing with \\
long slender trees; each \\
arching under the weight \\
of blue glass. \\
%
% A house at its end
% rope wound on the trees
% and the humming grew loud
% it rattled the leaves
% blue bottles clanked symphonies
% to cacophonous tunes
% of leather-pressed soles
% propelling me to my doom
%
% The door bristled out
% with barely a touch
% I stepped through the portal
% with timbering thrusts expecting much worse
% than doileys and dust

% I eased through the passage
% while walls whispered at me

% Twelve women sat idle
% in the room at the end
% they all dressed the same:
%   grey hair in a bun,
%   earth-toned to the floor
%   in loose-fitted garbs;
%   arms crossed in front
%   left-over right
%   each with a pillow
%   pressed tight to their chest
%
% "Sit"
%
% Walked faintly
% but punctuated still
% air in my lungs
%
% I entered the circle
% to sit with the others
% not knowing that I
% was the last of the coven
