Signals were lost in the dark mist \\
condeming me to a loop of \\
fettered anxiety wound around tracks \\
that laid limbless and cold. \\
\\
But as day approached night \\
the metal folded and twisted \\
compounding resolutions \\
of cordite constructions \\
of man \\
held in silent fixation \\
as light barrelled forth. \\
\\
The train struck iron and \\
timbered to its side \\
where ashen groves \\
raised from the marred steel \\
and the dead uprooted their cars, \\
laying trails with their veins. \\ % vines?
\\
\hspace*{4ex}\textit{The green never seemed} \\
\hspace*{4ex}\textit{so inviting before\ldots} \\
\\
I wandered that path \\
to its end where a house \\
sat in a clearing with \\
long slender trees; each \\
arching under the weight \\
of blue glass. \\
\\
I walked to the porch \\
and laid five knocks \\
upon the door which bristled \\
with each ebat.  When \\
I stopped, it disolved \\
at my feet \\
and I stepped \\
into the world within. \\
\\
The hall was bare; \\
little more than doileys and dust. \\
A single frame \\
stood before me \\
and each step closer \\
I became \\
the silence rearranged. \\
It no longer screamed but \\
whispered in my head. \\

\\
Twelve women--- \\
all dressed the same--- \\
sat motionless in a circle. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}Grey hair, tied in a bun; \\
\hspace*{4ex}Earth-toned to the floor \\
\hspace*{6ex}in loose-fitted robes; \\
\hspace*{4ex}Each set of arms, crossed, \\
\hspace*{6ex}left over right. \\
\hspace*{4ex}Each woman barring a pillow \\
\hspace*{6ex}tight to their chest. \\
\\
An empty chair compelled me; \\
so I entered the circle \\
and sat with the others \\
not realizing that I \\
was the last of that coven. \\
\\
One by one, they stood \\
and entered another room. \\
I sat alone \\
listening to twin cats purr \\
and when I'd finally \\
had enough, I too \\
wandered to the other room. \\
\\
Smoke hit my face; \\
quickly whisked away. \\
\hspace*{4ex}She smiled. \\
"I'm not a witch," \\
\hspace*{4ex}she said, \\
"Witches brew. \\
\ \ I'm a seer, but you--- \\
\ \ you have power--- \\
\ \ wretched power. \\
\ \ Now sit and have faith \\
\ \ in the arcana." \\
