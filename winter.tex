\\
Winter turns to Spring. \\
Spring to Summer to Fall. \\
\\
Winter is here again... \\
  or did it never leave? \\
\\
Fog begins to set \\
  as thoughts fade away. \\
\\
All that's left... that desolate grave. \\
Cold blue lips... that silence I crave. \\
\\
Warmth is long forgotten; \\
a chill lingers in the air. \\
\\
Frost settles all around. \\
I can no longer feel the ground. \\
%Life moves among the trees \\
%  but all I see are faded leaves, \\
%  forgotten mirth, \\
%  and frozen earth. \\
\\
Winter turns to Spring. \\
Spring to Summer to Fall. \\
Another year gone \\
  awaiting death to call. \\
