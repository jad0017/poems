\\
I found myself listless and lost under carmel skies as the sun set overhead. \\
Just me and my steering wheel getting more intimate than a human should with
an inanimate object covered with sticky aging pleather. \\
I was ready to give and go in for a kiss when the house came into view. \\
It was a brick house.  And ALL Brick House.  It knew it had everything
that a house needs to give family.  \\
900 by 800 square feet of salacious shale and clay \\
just waiting to be lived in. \\
\\
I pulled into the spacious driveway laying fresh tire over the new concrete.
