The attic is always \\
where my grandmother held her memories. \\
We would trod through trenches \\
of old dresses and yellowed toys \\
to where we found her memoirs of Germany \\
written across the worn edges \\
and hair-line cracks covering porcelin \\
and wood artifacts from an age \\
before my time. \\
\\
I would smooth my hands over \\
the raised edges of a stein \\
proudly declairing itself from Berlin \\
in great arched letters above \\
a piper cased in faded laquere \\
as he played a song for a crowd \\
of merry men leiderhosed and \\
smiling. \\
\\
And I would smile too \\
as I gripped the pewter handler, \\
depressed the flowered lip, \\
peered deep into the stone \\
chasm that lay within, and wander \\
across the continents to a place \\
I'd never been but dreamt of \\
in gooey gumbdrop mountains. \\
\\
She would set a woolen alpine hat \\
on my head that would slip down \\
over my eyes and sing to me\ldots{} \\
\\
\textit{Abends, will ich schlafen gehn,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{((aah-benz, vill isch shh-laugh-in gain))}} \\
\textit{Vierzehn Engel um mich stehn.} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{((virt-zing ANgle oom mich stEEn))}} \\
\\
Before leading me back down \\
the wheezing stairwell, \\
wrapped tight in my blanket\ldots{} \\
\\
\textit{Zwei zu meinen H{\"a}upten,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye Zoo mInE-in Hole-pin)}} \\
\textit{Zwei zu meinen F{\"u}{\ss}en,} \\

\\
I remember how we would visit \\
the neighbor who always seemed to have cookies \\
as big as my face \\
and how I would always take two \\
because I had two hands \\
and what's a hand without a cookie? \\
\\
\textit{Zwei zu meiner Rechten,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye Zoo mIner resh-Tin)}} \\
\textit{Zwei zu meiner Linken,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye Zoo mIner lEEnk-in)}} \\
\\
I remember how we would play \\
on the swings in the backyard \\
and she would point out the angel \\
in the tree and tell me how \\
it was always watching over me. \\
\\
\textit{Zwei die mich decken,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye dee ME-ssh Dec-In)}} \\
\textit{Zwei die wecken,} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye dee Wec-In)}} \\
\\
I remember wandering \\
through the house calling her name \\
and refusing to listen to words. \\
\\
\textit{Zweie die mich weisen} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(zzW-eye-e dee Me-ssh WIse-In)}} \\
\textit{Zu Himmels Paradeisen.} \\
{\scriptsize\textit{(Zoo him-Ells par-ha-DIce-In)}} \\
\\
I remember when I was finally \\
old enough to understand\ldots{} \\
\\
\ldots{} \\
\textit{Fourteen angels stand around me} \\
\ldots{} \\
\textit{who point me} \\
\textit{the way to Heaven's Paradise.}
