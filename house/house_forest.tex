You left \\
Ashamed \\
Paralyzed \\ 
We enacted not through inhumanity \\
but mass predation of one another \\
No fight was in you \\
But there was the scythe \\
Though the field was bare \\
Still from the scars before \\
We never heal \\
You carried the look of life \\
Happened to see the children \\
With smiles standing on air \\
Sucking the deeds---dominion \\
Like coffee beans \\
Machines to visceral remains \\
True nature \\
Not nurture \\
Light as it attacks the Earth \\
Necessary \\
\\
We lost \\
Discarded \\
Depleted \\
Larvae to the mountains \\
