You left \\
Ashamed \\
Paralyzed \\
We acted not through inhumanity \\
But mass predation of one another. \\
No fight was in you \\
But there was the scythe \\
Though this field was bare \\
From the scars before \\
We never heal. \\
You carried the look of life, \\
Happened to see the children \\
With smiles, standing on air \\
The deeds---their dominion--- \\
Our machines to visceral remains \\
Light as it attacks the Earth \\
Necessary. \\
\\
We lost \\
Discarded \\
Depleted \\
Larvae to the mountains \\
