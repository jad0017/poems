You're like an extended metaphor--- \\
That house from the 70s \\
That had more shag than shagging \\
With a CRT that always seemed to \\
Play Nixon or Ford \\
Even when Carter was in office; \\ % sex, she's thinkin' of other men
Filled with more curved objects \\
Than Jeremy's past employment \\
At a risque establishment. \\
Your bits and nobs are \\
Just painted brass \\
only sparkling under \\
The flicker of tube lights. \\
You're just not a house \\
I want to live in anymore. \\
You're just too pre- \\
To my post-modern needs. \\
I hope you understand. \\
You'll find someone in time \\
Who can handle your fresh \\
Orange exterior. \\
It's just not for me. \\
You're interior \\
just seems all too dirty \\
for someone so Mr. Clean. \\
I am slamming this door \\
and we will never open it again. \\
