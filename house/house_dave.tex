You're like an extended metaphor--- \\
That house form the 70s \\
That had more shag than shagging \\
With a CRT that always seemed to \\
Play Nixon or Ford \\
Even when Carter was in office; \\
Filled with more curved objects \\
Than Jeremy's past employment \\
At a risque establishment. \\
Your bits and nobs are \\
Just painted brass \\
only sparkling under \\
The flicker of tube lights. \\
You're just not a house \\
I want to live in anymore. \\
You're just too pre- \\
To my post-modern needs. \\
I hope you understand. \\
You'll find someone in time \\
Who can handle your fresh \\
Orange exterior. \\
It's just not for me. \\
It all seems a little too dirty \\
for someone so Mr. Clean. \\
