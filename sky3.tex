\multicolumn{1}{c}{\large\textbf{And The Sky Was Gone Forever}} \\
\\
Have you ever woken up in some surreal daze? \\
Grabbed some coffee; black, with an ice cub to cool\ldots{} \\
Maybe munched on some toast while taking in the calm \\
with big slow breaths fully expanding your lungs\ldots{} \\
And then you dress yourself and step out of the front door\ldots{} \\
--- ---\\
And everything comes crashing---the fuck---around you \\
As you remember and realize and conclude that \\
The Sky is gone forever and never coming back. \\
And the darkness rushes and folds around you \\
As the sun no longer has a seat on which to set. \\
The air grows cold to the point where your heart can't beat \\
And that buzzing in your ears grows and grows until you \\
Finally come to the conclusion that the buzzing is your brain; not your ears \\
Because your brain is filled up with nothingness \\
As your heart kicks back in much faster than it should\ldots{} $<\text{breath}>$ \\
\\
\h{}And you faint in the twilight of memories\ldots{} \\
\h{}Under the flickering lights \\
\h{}Shallow breath ; unnerved my heart \\
\h{}At the sight of your sullen corpse; \\
\h{}Bloodied and falling apart\ldots{} \\
\h{}Since all I could do was call your name \\
\h{}And wish that I arrived sooner. \\
\h{}I know I shouldn't feel guilt. \\
\h{}I know I'm not to blame. \\
\h{}But your stricken expression visits my dreams \\
\h{}over and over \\
\h{}I imagine what felled you \\
\h{}What you must have felt. \\
\\
\h{}Red tides carry wash your feet \\
\h{}As you collapse on the tiled floor \\
\\
\h{}Always so much more blood. \\
\h{}Always so much darker. \\
\h{}The shadow's dissonance \\
\h{}Consumes your body \\
\h{}As I burst through the door \\
\h{}And see you laying there \\
\h{}With red in your eyes. \\
\\
\h{}My Sky was lost forever. \\
\h{}She was taken with the tide. \\
\h{}The cuts on her wrists \\
\h{}Glistened into still seas. \\
