The apricot sky \\
looks down upon me. \\
\\
Laughing as the shadows \\
move and encircle \\
their prey. \\
\\
The street lamp's light \\
caresses me --- consoling --- \\
but it wont last. \\
\\
The power will cut. \\
The birds will gawk. \\
The dogs will hunt. \\
And the blackness--- \\
the imperceptible--- \\
will be within reach. \\
\\
These things should be nightmares \\
but I'm not asleep. \\
\\
Those shades without eyes \\
without ears \\
without form \\
will find me\ldots{} \\
\\
here by this lamp post. \\
Certainly this will be my grave. \\
\\
Entombed along a leisurely stroll \\
back to my home. \\
\\
I shouldn't have stayed out so late. \\
I'm not prepared to die. \\
\\
But there's no where to run. \\
I'm stuck --- I'm done. \\
\\
I'll just lay down and cry \\
until the shades take me away. \\
\\
Goodbye. \\
