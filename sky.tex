The morning came---a tragedy. \\
I opened that door to find \\
the sky had gone forever. \\
\\
Just an empty house \\
with nothing left to wait for. \\

But yet you haunt me \\
at night. \\
Every night \\
you kill me \\
with a different face \\
but your silloete is still there. \\
Always there---watching. \\
You are faceless. \\
You have form, but bodyless. \\
It's still you. \\
It's always you. \\
\\
Every time I die you're there. \\
Knife to the heart. \\
Axe to the head. \\
Arrow to the neck. \\
Every time. \\
\\
``It's your fault.  You did this.'' \\
\\
You killed me. \\
But have I not suffered enough? \\
Why are you alive in here \\
and I'm the one who's dying? \\
\\
There are no cuts on my wrists. \\
No need to feel pain. \\
I already have you. \\
And that's more than any knife will do. \\
\\
You got your out. \\
Leave me be. \\
