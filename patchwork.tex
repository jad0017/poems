\textbf{Patchwork} \\
\\
We knit our DNA \\
into tight landscapes \\
of locality shielded \\
by zeniths higher than ourselves \\ % [ than we wish to climb ]
and dregs deeper than we dare to dive. \\ % [ than we wish to plumit ]
Our waters are stagnant, yet \\
we find the solace \\
in our sanctity; \\
feeding our lives \\
with wonders and struggles; \\
values upon virtues. \\
\\
What decency do we lose \\
when we cannot see our flesh \\
as worth but as currency? \\
\\
The emptiness just fills \\
with words and emotions \\
searching for balance; \\
the voices begin to \\
stutter. \\
\\
Where is the sternness \\
among such fragile phrases? \\
\\
What tales must we novelize \\
and harvest to stop the corruption? \\
\\
Stitch after stitch, \\
the tighter we weave \\
the less we enjoy; \\
reaching out to inspect \\
our work as we tire \\
and tire\ldots \\
each stitch\ldots \\
each weave\ldots \\
We are patchwork. \\
