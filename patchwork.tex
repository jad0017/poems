\textbf{Patchwork} \\
\\
Knitting the DNA \\
as reticles for us to peer \\
to the zenith \\
to the dregs \\
and each level there-entwined \\
we find the solace \\
in our sanctity \\
%of our dreams \\
feeding our lives \\
with wonders and struggles \\
Virtues upon virtues \\
What decency do we lose \\
When we can't see our flesh \\
as worth but as currency? \\
The emptiness just fills \\
%with words and flashes \\
%of emotions. \\
with words and emotions. \\
Searching for balance \\
the voices begin to \\
stutter. \\
Where is the sternness \\
among such fragile phrases? \\
What tales must we novelize \\
and harvest to stop the corruption? \\
Stitch after stitch \\
%loop, stab, pull, cross, loop, kneed, \\
%rotate, pull, loop, cross, kneed, \\
%stab. \\
%\textit{loop, kneed, pull, cross, loop, kneed} \\
\textit{loop, kneed, pull, cross.} \\
The tighter we weave \\
the less we enjoy \\
reaching out to inspect \\
our work as we tire \\
and tire \\
each stitch \\
each weave \\
%loop, stab, pull, cross, loop, kneed, \\
%rotate, pull, loop, cross, kneed, \\
%\textit{loop, kneed, pull, cross, loop, kneed} \\
\textit{loop, kneed, pull, cross,} \\
\textit{loop, kneed, pull, cross,} \\
stab. \\
