Let me tell you a story \\
about a little boy. \\
He was shrouded in night \\
and the shadows turned their heads. \\
He was\hspace*{4ex}one of them. \\
\\
In the softened sussers, \\
twilight's song hung languid by his side. \\
He brought his blanked to his chin \\
and let the silence pull him in \\
until his eyes fell closed. \\
\\
One night the shadows felt his presence \\
and the flesh they craved \\
unadorned and unscathed; \\
untouched \\
and\hspace*{4ex}so full of life. \\
\\
The sussers rose to screams \\
as pale static accosted his eyes. \\
Lids lighter than before; unshuttered \\
seeking steeples but slave to apparition dread. \\
His heart broke free \\
and his coveres smothered his breath. \\
\\
The shadows reached out \\
to creep through the bundle \\
of fear-soaked boy.  \\
Their long, convulsing fingers \\
coalesced with his skin; his blood \\
suffused by their oil. \\
\\
The shades colluded in his solemn hours \\
and sunk their aching into his lungs, \\
austere to his dread with a \\
salacious antiquity heathering midnight's dress \\
as they whispered away his mind. \\
\\
The boy laid still, \\
conspired by the dark; \\
a cadaver at his wake; \\
a vessel left unfilled; \\
a carapace to this day. \\
