Let me tell you a story \\
about a little boy. \\
He was shrouded in night \\
and the shadows turned their heads. \\
He was\hspace*{4ex}one of them. \\
\\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{Softened sussers of shallow tones---} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{the twilight's song hung languid} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{by my side.  I brought my blanket} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{to my chin and let the silence pull} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{me in until my eyes fell closed.} \\
\\
One night the shadows felt \\
his presence and the flesh they craved \\
unadorned and unscathed; untouched \\
and\hspace*{4ex}so full of life. \\
\\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{Sussers rose to screams;} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{debauched in paralysis.} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{The nothingness termites---} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{pale static accosted my eyes;} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{lids lighter than before; unshuttered,} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{seeking steeples but slave to} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{apparition dread.  My heart broke free} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{and covers smothered my breath.} \\
\\
Their hands reached out \\
to creep through the bundle \\
of fear-soaked boy.  One long \\
convulsing finger coalesced \\
with his skin; his blood \\
suffused by their oil. \\
\\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{Shades colluded in my solemn hours} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{and sunk ancient aching in my lungs;} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{they fed me anodyne air,} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{austere to my dread with} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{salacious antiquity heathering} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{midnight's dress and} \\
\multicolumn{1}{r}{whispered away my mind.} \\
\\
The boy laid still, \\
conspired by the dark; \\
a cadaver at his wake; \\
a vessel left unfilled; \\
a carapace to this day. \\
