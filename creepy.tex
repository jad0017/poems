\textbf{Creepy Women} \\
\\
\textbf{I} \\
\\
To the woman at the Hallmark store \\
who told me in very direct terms \\
that I look like the kind of guy \\
who would be planning to purchase \\
a knife after picking out an adorable \\
Christmas card covered with penguins \\
and that I should not cut myself \\
because ``that would be bad.'' \\
\\
I don't know if you were trying to flirt \\
but I'm afraid your personality just doesn't \\
fit my imagination of a Hallmark casheir. \\
I just wanted to buy a card for my friend \\
and leave that depressing place called a mall. \\
\\
\textbf{II} \\
\\
To the girl sitting on the curb of \\
the only free parking spot \\
within twenty feet of my apartment \\
complex at 9:15 p.m. on Saturday night. \\
I know you're on the phone, \\
probably dealing with some shit, \\
but I gotta park, \\
so could you \\
scoot over a bit? \\
\\
Don't just glare at me \\
as I ease slowly into the spot \\
carefully navegating my nose \\
to rest 32 inches from your \\
right knee. \\
\\
You could have stood up \\
and avoided this all \\
but now it's done \\
so why don't you just \\
carry on with your call. \\
\\
And stop looking at me \\
with that expression lacking \\
any simbolance of glee. \\
\\
\textbf{III} \\
\\
To my (thankfully) ex-coworker who \\
would stare at me and hover about \\
my left shoulder, breathing plaque-caked \\
air onto my face. \\
\\
Could you please brush your teeth, \\
scrub your tounge until you bleed, \\
and get the fuck away from me? \\
\\
I realize this is my fault \\
since I act ``nice'' and ``inviting'' \\
but I'm a terrible person \\
who would rather never see you again. \\
\\
\textbf{IV} \\
\\
To all the others to come \\
please just leave me alone. \\
