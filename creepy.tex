\textbf{Creepy Women} \\
\\
To the girl sitting on the curb of \\
the only free parking spot \\
within twenty feet of my apartment \\
complex at 9:15 p.m. on Saturday night. 
I know you're on the phone, \\
probably dealing with some shit, \\
but I gotta park, \\
so could you \\
scoot over a bit? \\
\\
Don't just glare at me \\
as I ease slowly into the spot \\
carefully navegating my nose \\
to rest 32 inches from your \\
right knee. \\
\\
You could have stood up \\
and avoided this all \\
but now it's done \\
so why don't you just \\
carry on with your call. \\
\\
