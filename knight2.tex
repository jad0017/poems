I remember it like it was yesterday. \\
It was a small community on the outskirts \\
of the Widdershin Kingdom. \\
\\
\\
``Oh, how much you've grown. \\
You once were a bridge \\
and now you're a whole village \\
just begging to be burned.'' \\
\\
I lept from my perch, \\
spiraled on down \\
and left a crater \\
in the center of town. \\
\\
After a full day of fun \\
I flew back to my cave \\
to waste away another decade. \\
\\
Several months went by before \\
the brave little hero wandered \\
through my door. \\
\\
I was snuggled up tight in my wings \\
surrounded by all of my things \\
when the man stabbed me. \\
\\
I grumbled awake \\
shaking the dust from my back. \\
%it tingled my nose
Achoo! \\
\\
The man flew across the cave \\
and I felt really bad about the whole thing \\
that's not how these things go. \\
\\
The hero is suppose to face the dragon \\
in a fierce battle, not be thrown by a sneeze. \\
\\
So stumbled over to help the man up \\
and the next thing I knew my foot \\
was covered in his guts. \\
\\
I swept up his body, \\
gave it a light roast \\
and tossed it off the mountain \\
with a Return to Sender note. \\
\\
They never did send me a replacement.
