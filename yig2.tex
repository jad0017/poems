\textbf{The Yellow Robe} \\ \hline
\\
The ivory throne once glistened \\
under (the) hind of a wayward king. \\
The fields always produced \\
and the livestock were merry. \\
\\
``Where the spinner in darkness \\
haunts the abyss, \\
drink from my chalice--- \\
a dark-red kiss.'' \\
\\
The whispers breathed on and on. \\
\\
``Deep in the woods where the widows prey, \\
five candles are set upon a floor of clay. \\
Shadows are cast unpon the pentacle star. \\
where the mad king will whisper: \\
\textit{Kaal'm tha'lu yig-d'gaar}.'' \\
\\
The chaos compounded the prophecy so. \\
\\
The king was lost \\
and his throne destroyed. \\
The fields were burned \\
and the live stock diseased. \\
\\
``Royalty rests \\
and hunger spreads \\
by my caress.'' \\
\\
When the Elder broke through the sky \\
and the end set upon us. \\
\\
``The world weeps \\
by flesh and flame \\
no morsal of man \\
remains.'' \\
\\
Pillars of flesh errupt from the Earth \\
as tombs of fire descend \\
to engulf us. \\
\\
``For a single thread wisps awry \\
and untangle the world.'' \\
