\\
The ivory throne once glistened \\
under (the) hind of a wayward king. \\
The fields always produced \\
and the livestock were merry. \\
\\
``Where the spinner in darkness \\
haunts the abyss, \\
drink from my chalice--- \\
a dark-red kiss.'' \\
\\
The whispers breathed on and on. \\
\\
``Deep in the woods where the widows prey, \\
five candles are set upon a floor of clay. \\
Shadows are cast unpon the pentacle star. \\
where the mad king will whisper: \\
\textit{Kaal'm tha'lu yig-d'gaar}.'' \\
\\
The whispers compounded the prophecy so. \\
\\
``Royalty will rest\ldots{}''
%\\
%``A single thread wisps awry \\
%and unwravles the world.'' \\
\\
The king was lost \\
and his throne destroyed. \\
\\
``\ldots{}and hunger will spread\ldots{}''
\\
The fields were burned \\
and the live stock diseased. \\
\\
``Those that are left\ldots{}''
\\
When the Elder broke through the sky \\
and the end set upon us. \\
\\
``\ldots{}will wish they are dead\ldots{}''
\\
His walls of eyes quiver as he walks. \\
His appendages undulate as he screams. \\
\\
``For a single thread may whisp awry\ldots{}'' \\
\\
Pillars of flesh errupt from the Earth \\
as tombs of fire descend \\
to engulf us. \\
\\
``\ldots{}and untangle the world\ldots{}''
\\
Now we wait for our deaths to come. \\
\\
``\ldots{}into chaos.''
