\\
The ivory throne once glistened \\
under (the) hind of a wayward king. \\
The fields always produced \\
and the livestock were merry. \\
\\
``Where the spinner in darkness \\
haunts the abyss, \\
drink from my chalice--- \\
a dark-red kiss.'' \\
\\
The whispers breathed on and on. \\
\\
``Deep in the woods where the widows prey, \\
five candles are set upon a floor of clay. \\
Shadows are cast unpon the pentacle star. \\
where the mad king will whisper: \\
\textit{Kaal'm tha'lu yig-d'gaar}.'' \\
\\
The silence compounded the prophecy so. \\
%\\
%``A single thread wisps awry \\
%and unwravles the world.'' \\
\\
The king was lost \\
and his throne destroyed\ldots{} \\
\\
The fields were burned \\
and the live stock diseased\ldots{} \\
\\
When the Elder broke through the sky \\
and the end set upon us. \\
\\
His tombs of fire descending. \\
His pillars of death unending. \\
\\
Now we wait for our deaths to come. \\
\\
``A single thread wisps awry \\
and unwravles the world.'' \\
