\textbf{I'm Not A Monster} \\
\\
``I'm not a monster'' \\
I tell myself every day \\
while I stare at my fangs \\
and their bleak white \\
beneath the night of my lips \\
and the rot in my eyes \\
as I commune with shallower tides. \\
\\
These travestites I've sewn \\
are hot for the marrow of my condemnation \\
with the stern resolve and stubborn passion \\
I've slowly cast on the world. \\
\\
Still I wait for the day \\
that the canyons and the seas \\
within my soul envelope me \\
as I reap, haphazardly, \\
the pastures I've come to depend. \\
\\
\textit{Can't you walk among the stars?} \\
\textit{Can't you follow their trails?} \\
\\
My memories breathe the moon as a pillar \\
and pour bitter reality surreal. \\
I am but cobwebs and detest; \\
unhallowed fores of midnight, \\
profound and awake \\
to the dispassioned echoes of my eidolon. \\
