\textbf{Broken Litany} \\
\\
Your magic melted \\
long ago, but \\
your legacy still drapes \\
this mass \\
of broken wings. \\
\\
Far above the water \\
where the cliffs of conscience peer \\
sits my heart, \\
emulsified in vinegar. \\
\\
It is displayed by dusty shelves \\
within my shack. \\
\\
The yellowed glass \\
hides the color \\
of my past. \\
\\
I am dead now, \\
seeking comfort \\
within my grave \\ % within my head?
while you try to breath \\
new dawn into me. \\
\\
Gods above: \\
I am not confined \\
to your tragedy. \\
\\
But with those \\
empty faces \\
quietly making love \\
beneath the dirt and clay. \\
