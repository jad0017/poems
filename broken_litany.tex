\textbf{Broken Litany} \\
\\
Far above the water \\
where the cliffs of conscience peer \\
sits my heart, \\
emulsified in vinegar. \\
\\
It is displayed by dusty shelves \\
within your shack. \\
\\
The yellowed glass \\
hides the colors \\
of our past. \\
\\
I am dead now, \\
seeking comfort \\
within my head \\
while you try to breath \\
new dawn into me---\\
into us. \\
\\
But I am not confined to your tragedy, \\
just with those empty faces \\
quietly making love \\
beneath the dirt and clay. \\
