\textbf{Broken Litany} \\
\\
Far above the water \\
where the cliffs of conscience peer \\
sits my heart, \\
emulsified in vinegar. \\
\\
It is displayed by dusty shelves \\
within your shack. \\
\\
The yellowed glass \\
hides the color \\
of our past. \\
\\
I am dead now, \\
seeking comfort \\
within my head \\
while you try to breath \\
new dawn into me. \\
\\
I am not confined to your tragedy, \\
but with those empty faces \\
quietly making love \\
beneath the dirt and clay. \\
