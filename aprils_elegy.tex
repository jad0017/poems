The gentle breeze you conjured has left this place \\

Your monument---your astounding voice--- \\
whispered in agony when forced to raise, \\
grips my heart that longs to stave \\
these porcelin walls crumbling away. \\
\\
This house is stirred and rattled (cold) \\
as the gales keep knocking shuttered glass \\
effaced by tears and malted years \\
witheld to solitude and greener hills \\
(just) a dream's step away from this shale and clay \\
\\
were your spirit walks on through those you passes \\
your love for life's little joys: \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}Small animals in tiny sweaters \\
\hspace*{4ex}A cup of Joe---darker than night \\
\hspace*{4ex}A tall glass of red wine, or six \\
