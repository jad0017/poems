% Because Left -> Leave and there's some LeaveS here...
\textbf{Left in the Woods} \\
\\
\textbf{I} \\
\\
Through the cracks in these walls \\
I peer away the days. \\
\\
Tiny feet \\
and the chatter they bring \\
keep me alive \\
beneath these leaves. \\
%where the fungi grows. \\
\\
\textbf{II} \\
\\
Nothing aches. \\
I cannot breath. \\
It's just me \\
and this canopy of trees. \\
\\
Tiny feet have left \\
with bits of me in hand. \\
\\
\textbf{III} \\
\\
The dead crunch. \\ % dead (leaves)
Larger strides approach. \\
But I cannot see, \\
now that a gust has covered me. \\
\\
Feet step \\
and enter my home. \\
\\
\textbf{IV} \\
\\
Walls scatter. \\
Face to face; \\
\\
Are they trespassers? \\
Are they theives? \\
\\
The couple screams \\
and runs from me. \\
\\
A body \\
in the sun or beneath the trees \\
%--- broken and rotten --- \\
I'm just a body in the leaves. \\
