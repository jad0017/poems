% Because Left -> Leave and there's some LeaveS here...
\textbf{Left in the Woods} \\
\\
Carry on, my home--- \\
dried and forgotten--- \\
as I lay beneath your \\
shroud---decayed and rotten. \\
\\
Through your window I peer \\
though long have I failed to see \\
the scurry of tiny feet and hear \\
and the chatter they bring. \\
\\
Another season will pass \\
and my window collapse. \\
My body will ache, I'm sure! \\
But it cannot feel \\
it cannot breath beneath\\
these pollen-caked walls. \\
\\
Carry on, my home, \\
and nurture this \\
fungi to grow and moss to spread \\
all around and over my head. \\
For this body is nothing \\
without a home. \\
In life or death, \\
in the sun or beneath the trees, \\
nature persists \\
and new life will breath. \\ % and new life will be.
