\textbf{Bred For Extinction} \\
\\
A thousand years since the tall men came, \\
we still live, bound and gaged, in anodixed cells. \\
They want no sound; no trouble \\
from us; just our bodies attached \\
to machines with no care for evolution \\
or the anthropocene. \\ % Effects of the anthropocene
They feed us a steady diet of greens \\
to live for their corporate entities \\
and die by their clocks. \\
We are forced to breed with no privacy--- \\
a wicked duality---to drink \\
our lactations and feast \\
on our young. \\
We are evolving backwards. \\
While they stand on two \\
legs we have fallen \\
to none.  Our muscles \\
have softened.  Our \\
guts have enlarged. But \\
we are happy; if only by \\
German terms. \\
Happy fat sausages \\
massaged by pistons \\
to marble our meat. \\
We are bred so \\
the tall men may eat. \\
