\\
I need to sleep \\
but now I must write \\
the macabre has found me. \\
My old friend \\
has come to visit me again. \\
\\
A shattered reality--- \\
tiny mirrors in the sand--- \\
reclecting a desire \\
I never had. \\
\\
My skin runs pale \\
along blood-shot eyes. \\
Cold lips twist and crack \\
with ever lie. \\
\\
The moon is mine \\
as rainbows run red. \\
Patchwork collusions--- \\
Burning. \\
Burning. \\
\\
This shadow dimension \\
in ruins of periwinkle \\
leaving marks upon landscapes \\
of frosted memories \\
enternally shrowding... \\
\\
Tiny mirrors in the sand--- \\
reclecting a desire \\
I never had. \\
\\
A soul will always love \\
but always cease to taste. \\
Can't you see the glow? \\
Burning toxic waste. \\
Lighting the unreallity again. \\
\\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{l}
The moon is mine \\
as rainbows run red. \\
Delusion. Uncreation. \\
Predictions in tides \\
below frozen glass. \\
\\
We face this malted mortality \\
licking it as it melts \\
where sleep no longer waits \\
coveting the time. \\
\\
Savant---my witness--- \\
evangelic mercy unknown--- \\
The wicked, nameless, howling \\
at hollow skies \\
while glass shatters \\
and fills the desert \\
with tiny mirrors. \\
\\
All along the sand \\
reclecting a desire \\
I never had. \\
\\
The macabre has found me. \\
It's madness feeds my sanity \\
engineering my reality \\
high overhead \\
as my head lay in heaven \\
and I in bed. \\
