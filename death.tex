\textbf{Death's Little Sister} \\ \hline
\\
This is the desert which swallows all hope. \\
Open the window; breathe the stale air. \\
You've already lost; there's no one to care. \\
Find the spire and bring a rope. \\
Fall--It's a long way down. \\
Fall--you'll miss the ground. \\
See the people; feel their hate. \\
These are the ones that sealed your fate. \\
\\
The desert does not end. \\
Walk--you will wander forever-- \\
and forget your stupid endeavor. \\
Burn--curse the sun. \\
Incinerate this world; ease your pain. \\
Take the knife; what's not to gain? \\
Let the blade fall; rest against the wall. \\
\\
You still have a choice. \\
\\
The endless desert hides a door; \\
the only refuge from this constant war. \\
The door is locked with hope its key. \\
Find it and set us free. \\
