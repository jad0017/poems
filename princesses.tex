I know what I write \\
I know my own mind \\
repitition \\
repitition \\
ghosts, gizzards, and files \\
I fill up the ether \\
and slap on some eyes. \\
\\
The meister composed my end \\
with esses and esses, spite \\
spilling mucus on suspicious \\
skeletons mocking sensible \\
constructions by selectively \\
selection one of several \\
selections that I've beat \\
and beat past satisified \\
to suffering in every \\
situation. \\
\\
Quoth the indignant ``You're a whore \\
to your craft on a mental metal melancholy \\
satiated by your lust to present a moral folly \\
with vague corollaries and a knack for indifference.'' \\
\\
But oh, I'm the daft one, am I? \\
Shall I invoke Mother Earth? \\
I'm sure she'll see it from my side. \\
We've got a deal with the clouds that \\
it's always raining and I'm sure a bit \\
of lightning wouldn't be off the table. \\
\\
Hollow words \\
Empty promises \\
and odd bits of leather \\
are the things that I know, \\
shells are light as a feather \\
and easy for me to move with \\
my tiny little arms, now I'm \\
a talking T-Rex and I run a \\
chicken farm but you'll never \\
hear my cluck, all my eggs \\
are in the coop which is never \\
full of poop, because I keep \\
eating the birds. \\
\\
Trust me, that made sense, \\
don't think about it hard, \\
it's a hare not a turtle \\
what about that don't you see? \\

\\
I think I'll go now \\
and write about a tree \\
one with tongues everywhere; \\
one that whispers to me. \\
\\
It'll be all the rage in my \\
baggy nocturne eyes when I \\
see the bark is bumpy and \\
built on Cupid's thighs. \\
