\textbf{When Man is Laid to Rest} \\
\\
The Jack-O-s spat fire \\
through the tress where \\
thousands of eyes glinted \\
outside of the clearing, \\
and considered my existance \\
in the muggy halo \\
of burning canopy \\
where I sat. \\
\\
The eyes danced and turned, \\
circling around me, \\
bluring as they approached \\
centerfugal speeds. \\
\\
The Earth rattled as they spun \\
the leaves into the sky. \\
\\
The eyes blinked. \\
The gale ceased. \\
And Tounges rained down upon me. \\
\\
I tried to run, but the \\
bump-laiden mounds were \\
licking my progress away. \\
\\
Giant teeth ruptured from the \\
bed of tounges and forced me \\
back to the center where \\
the stump stood. \\
\\
The rotten wood bubbled oozing flesh \\
from the rings of time.  Two naughted \\
eyes rolled out of the mass and locked \\
with my own. \\
\\
The stump spoke with long, gurgled, syllables. \\ % s/syllables/spits/ ?

\hspace*{4ex}We created \textit{beings} to ease the strain on our lives. \\
\hspace*{4ex}But our minds were torture;\\
\hspace*{4ex}screams adhered to silence. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}We were \\

\hspace*{4ex}speckled \\
\hspace*{4ex}accross the corpreal: \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}the misanthropic hues \\
\hspace*{4ex}against their grays. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}We gave them \textit{emotions} \\
\hspace*{4ex}to assauge our discomfort. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}But they were never right; never perfect. \\
\hspace*{4ex}And in time, as our boredom grew, we tossed them aside. \\
\\
Red veins sprouted from the stumps mouth \\
and wound around my legs \\
as the wood liquified into a fleshy puddle. \\
\\
I could feel the whole forest \\
pulsing, tuning my heart to its beat, \\
as the veins coiled up my body \\
and constricted me \\
into the cold sweat \\
of night where the stump \\
lingered on my retinas. \\
