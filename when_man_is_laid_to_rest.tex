\textbf{When Man is Laid to Rest} \\
\\
The moon cast spears \\
through the thick of woods \\
into the clearing where I sat \\
upon a rotting stump. \\
\\
There were shadows lurking all around\ldots \\
thusands of eyes glinting\ldots \\
considering my existance. \\
\\
They circled me behind the trees. \\
There eyes blured as they approached \\
centerfugal speeds. \\
\\
The leaves rattled from their rest, \\
spinning up into the sky\ldots \\
\\
The eyes blinked, \\
all at once. \\
The gale ceased \\
and tounges \\
rained down \\
upon me. \\
\\
I tried to run, but the leaves \\
kept licking my progress away. \\
\\
Teeth ruptured from the ground, \\
blocking my escape. \\
\\
They closed in. forcing me back to the center. \\
\\
The stump turned and twisted, \\
oozing skin from the rings of time, \\
rolling eyes out of the mass--- \\
locking with my own. \\
\\
It spoke with long, gurgled, syllables. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}We created \textit{beings} to ease the strain on our lives. \\
\hspace*{4ex}But our minds were torture---\\
\hspace*{4ex}screams adhered to silence. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}We were \\
\hspace*{4ex}chaotic energy \\
\hspace*{4ex}speckled \\
\hspace*{4ex}accross the corpreal: \\

\hspace*{4ex}the misanthropic hues \\
\hspace*{4ex}against their grays. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}We gave them \textit{emotions} \\
\hspace*{4ex}to assauge our discomfort. \\
\\
\hspace*{4ex}But they were never right; never perfect. \\
\hspace*{4ex}And in time, as our boredom grew, we tossed them aside. \\
\\
The stump liquified, sprouting red veins \\
from it's puddle. \\
They wound around my legs\ldots \\
\\
I felt the forest pulsing \\
as my heart tuned itself \\
to the beat. \\
\\
The veins coiled up my body \\
and constricted me \\
into the cold \\
sweat of night. \\
