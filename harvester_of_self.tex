\textbf{The Harvester of Self} \\
\vspace*{2ex}
\begin{tabular}{l}
For years I've wandered this garden called my life \\
until I finally rooted from others, out of sight. \\
\\
One day I was torn asunder by the virulent ghost \\
that calls me host laying in heathered wake \\
on my twisted cloak of shame \\
as the midnight crows \\
on casks of flies. \\
\\
I became ataxic each September night \\
as my mind wandered and took flight \\
to the Fairy Feller's domain and dreamed \\
in constant pain. \\
\\
My eyes grew heavy with more rings than time, \\
more years than trees, tired and falling apart. \\
\\
For a moment, I closed my eyes, \\
and saw what sleep could bring \\
but it was over too soon \\
as each September my song slowed \\
but I could still hear its beat \\
thumping beneath my clothes. \\
\\
Even the Earth undressed, as I yearned to cover more \\
to silence my song, the life that wished to be worn \\
asking ``Who am I?'' \\
answering ``The solitary life is born to die.'' \\
\\
I was the loneliest rose.  I did not see. \\
I did not hear.  Yet I lived in fear \\
of the settlement I had created. \\
So I escaped to my mind where the Bellua hides. \\
\\
She clicked her tongue, and twisted about; \\
two arms, two legs, and a hundred heads of lies \\
speaking prophetic tones of cathedral blasphemy: \\
\textit{Words are not free, do not waste them so easily.} \\
and they festered within me. \\
\end{tabular}

\\
They came closer and sank with me, \\
her horns and her effigies. \\
Her thoughts enduring in my veins. \\
It wasn't enough to simply pray--- \\
all hanged, shrouding the garden, \\
with the thought that she'll find me \\
but she droped her eyes, frail, \\
like pendulums passing before my storm \\
of dreams reaching through, \\
forgetting the past's deluge \\
with ropes bound to my tears, \\
dropping the iron in my will. \\
\\
\textit{You used to contact the dead} \\
\textit{With three queens; white hats} \\
\textit{adorned every head; each pimple popped.} \\
\textit{You shouldn't have opened the box} \\
\textit{but now you carry a new dawn of fear,} \\
\textit{armed with clouds, descending with seeds,} \\
\textit{tired and forcing your paradise into mist} \\
\textit{and this necropolis.} \\
spoke the beast my reminder \\
that in this ataractic delusion, \\
unlike the hydra, \\
when I've cut of my head, \\
that's it. \\
There's nothing left. \\
\\
There's nothing left. \\
