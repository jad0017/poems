\textbf{Brown} \\
\\
Rich Sessile and Pedunculate Oak, \\
Charred to a toasty burnt umber. \\
Locked together, three years in that cellar, \\
Where malted barley lingers. \\
%With a caramelized aroma. \\
Long awaited that barrel was pulled \\
Vanillin, smoked, and spiced \\
Spilled from that lid, \\
A deep roasted carmine. \\
Decanted--filled to the brim. \\
Heathered and dignified \\
In a glass of fogged mahogany. \\
A perfectly balanced Scotch, \\
Softly drowning two stones. \\
