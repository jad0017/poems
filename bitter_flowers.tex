Fluttered wakes by astral tides \\
``I feel so light,'' \\
reveled my mind. \\

But aberration befell \\
and washed hope away. \\
%\\
%Embittered by stance \\
%I let my heart recount. \\
\\
\\
%Plague befell my kind. \\
%\\
We used to be free, \\
but our will\hspace{2ex} was destroyed. \\
The silver leaked out\hspace{2ex} when I \\
was just a boy. \\
\\
\\
The sun sauntered down \\
where the battle was waged. \\
%\\
Hundreds had fought. \\
Hundreds were slain! \\
\\
\\
Every stone writhed and turned. \\
The Earth had shown me life. \\
\\
\\
She plucked each star from the sky \\
and kissed my cheek goodnight. \\

I fluttered in wakes on astral tides \\
but a question burned \\
in my mind. \\
\\
I released to the ether\ldots{} \\
``My conscious persists\hspace{3ex}am I not alive?'' \\
%But the echoes were waning on darkened skies. \\

\textit{Her limbs ignite}\\
\textit{and engulf the fields}\\
\textit{of man.} \\
\\
\textit{Her lungs burst} \\
\textit{and smother the world} \\
\textit{with ash.} \\

\textit{Her heart erupts} \\
\textit{and drowns the Earth.} \\
\\
\textit{No more} \\
\textit{do the flowers burn.} \\
