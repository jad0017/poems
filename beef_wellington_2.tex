\textbf{A Poem About Beef Wellington} \\
{\footnotesize\textbf{And abosolutely nothing else.}} \\
\\
Are you aware, that in a true Wellington, \\
the duxelles is mostly dirt? \\
\\
You remind me of a nice plump Wellington. \\
The sorry weasels that live in holes; \\
too scared to leave the ground. \\
They cake themselves in mud and muck \\
to keep them from being found. \\
%as a means to throw off their hunt. \\
\\
But these sorry attempts to avoid predation \\
merely make them taste divine. \\
\\
How does it feel to be a log \\
with your entrails along your back? \\
So easy to pluck and rip your guts \\
as one deveins a shrimp? \\
\\
Evolution is ever so cruel, \\
you were always destined to be meat. \\
Dressed in dough and painted gold. \\
Oh, you're good enough to eat! \\
\\
Just like the Wellington, \\
you're ceaselessly still. \\
Nothing gives you pulse to rise. \\
You simply drift in a listless sea. \\
For when the world wakes you do not contend. \\
You offer your flesh as feed. \\
\\
Why would you saunter out from your home \\
when all that exists is there? \\
How does it feel to be so alone? \\
To always rack yourself in fear? \\
\\
Your comfort is a trap, though \\
I'm sure your stagnation \\
seems gracious; you're convinced \\
there is safety in their. \\
But wait, oh no, you could die \\
if you tripped on the stairs. \\
\\
All alone, stuck in your hole \\
away from the world at large, \\
and all the meanwhile \\
the world sharpens its claws \\
in wait of a glorious feast. \\
\\
Just you and the Wellington served up nice; \\
a sacrifice for the gluttonous beast. \\
