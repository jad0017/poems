I'm just a terrified man.

The apricot sky

looks down on me

The should be nightmares
but I'm not sleeping


-- They Are The Black --

They are the black
birds that gawk from a distance
as the apricot sky
looks down upon me 

They are the black
dogs that follow at a distance
as the shadows
fade into perception around me

They are the black
figures that watch within reach

They made me a terrified man

They should be nightmares
but I'm not sleeping.
