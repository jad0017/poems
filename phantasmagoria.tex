\textbf{Phantasmagoria} \\
\\
It was another normal night. \\
The house was quiet and still. \\
There was nothing to fear. \\
I was safe behind those walls. \\
\\
The twilight tranquility-- \\
Sublimeness of sleep-- \\
I thought would last forever-- \\
But forever can be bleak. \\
\\
From darkness it came-- \\
Amorphous figure of black. \\
\\
Faceless--It took my hand. \\
Faceless--It leaned and whispered to me-- \\
Austere, hollow, and grave. \\
\\
Back into darkness it went-- \\
Amorphous figure of black. \\
\\
Faceless--It cursed my life. \\
Faceless--It told me tales that lingered-- \\
Austere, hollow, and grave. \\
\\
It was another normal night. \\
The house was cadaverously still. \\
There was everything to fear \\
In that suffocated reality. \\
