\textbf{Ugly the Potatocorn} \\
%\\
%My mother used to tell me \\
%that potatocorns came in all \\
%shapes and sizes. \\
%Each spud was more unique and \\
%spudular than the next. \\
%I was a fool to believe \\
%the woman who named \\
%her son Ugly. \\
\\
Another day. \\
Another sour day. \\
This starch is too sweet--\\
A big yellow yam-- \\
That's who I am. \\
\\
They always mock me,
The potatocorns \\
with their solid white bodies. \\
