\\
He, of ivory throne, \\
with diabolical cries, \\
screams of silence \\
with hysterical eyes. \\
\\
\ldots{}the whispers keep breathing\ldots{} \\
\\
``Where the spinner in darkness \\
haunts the abyss, \\
drink from the chalice-- \\
a dark-red kiss.'' \\
\\
Deep in the woods where the widows prey \\
Five candles are set upon a floor of clay. \\
Shadows are cast on that pentacle star. \\
The mad king whispers: \textit{Kaal'm tha'lu yig d'gaar}. \\
\\
Twice-invoked on oblique lines; \\
space contorts to open the skies. \\
He who hunts, who eats insanity, \\
a fiend of night who dreams reality, \\
enters the world to spread calamity. \\
\\
The whispers have stopped. \\
Now the robe may sleep \\
while The Elder rides \\
and the living weep. \\
