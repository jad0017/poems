\textbf{Skin} \\
\\
People think \\
that I \\
measure my worth \\
with a leather sole. \\
That I \\
am set below a brushed upper facade \\
over some \\
argyle affair \\
crossing in and out of the darker corners \\
of my wardrobe. \\
People think \\
that I \\
feel most at home \\
behind a cabled sweater with \\
ridges deep enough \\
to shade my being. \\
But it's not my shoes, \\
not my \\
sweaters, \\
nor my socks. \\
\\
My skeleton \\
is a herd \\
of sinews I've spun \\
and waxed on my tongue. \\
\\
It is \\
the cap \\
I keep hidden \\
behind the luxury: \\
The white wool bonnet \\
with short little ears\ldots{} \\

The sheep in my dreams. \\
%They are all of me. \\
The \textit{all} of me. \\
\\
I count myself \\
to stay in line \\
%but my bretheren drove: \\
%hate whisps knit \\
%into quarrells never resolved\ldots \\
%\\
%My sheep are wolves \\
%preying on one another. \\
but my brethren drove, \\
my sheep, \\
are wolves \\
preying on one another: \\
hate wisps knit \\
into quarrels never resolved. \\
\\
A careful litany to younger days \\
tightly wound in fleece, \\
looking up to the stars \\
through the monoliths \\
of older minds. \\
\\
And every time \\
I slip \\
the matted wool over my head \\
and tie the yellowed ends \\
beneath my chin \\
I remember \\
that I \\
am those wolves. \\
