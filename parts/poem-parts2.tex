Can't you walk along the stars? \\
Can't follow their trail? \\
\\
In the dark, unforgiving, \\
this bitersweet ode to be. \\
Intertwined as they dance \\
anxiously waiting to shed their shells \\
So dark, that it triggers a breath. \\
So just for the stars, \\
let us slip in to forever. \\
Bring forth their reflections 


So fragile, \\
as the eons crept \\
into this pariahs tomb. \\
\\
Can't you walk among the stars? \\
Can't you follow their trails? \\
\\
We are burning all our laurels \\
in the dark, unforgiving, \\
this bitterweet ode to be \\
for the chance of another refraction. \\

Staggering, "let us slip into forever", \\
on our minds. In the halls, \\
anxiously awaiting \\
our imprudence to incubate \\
\\
"with love they may awaken." \\
"you kissed my body and passed." \\
I touch your dimise. \\
stone was soon his bones. \\
the ghost of life cannot be stopped. \\
bruised with the elms of woe. \\
\\
In your mind, you can deceive me.  you are waiting \\
for me and through me, you are bowing today. \\
Five angels are drowning in your golden chalice \\
as they warn of the frantic crown. \\
\\
It lurks beneath \\
as they are banished to open the cataclysms of their mortality \\
just enough for you to slip through your fiery arrows \\
like bestial laughts, eating the frenzy of a swan, \\
gliding on psychic wars \\
and the heads outside the comfort of angels \\
that fly away, taking their sons \\
that sit upon the morning start \\
where the butterflys appear in pairs. \\
\\
I am the frenzy of this endless light made on the backs of naked kings. \\
