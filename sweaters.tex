\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Ugly Sweaters and a Cardigan or Two}} \\\hline
\\
Ignominious if it were not December; \\
Ridiculous if it were not winter; \\
This vibrant atrocity; \\
This vortex of color and unicorn's puke; \\
\\
These cheap nits in red and black \\
Poorly adorned by rainbows and cats; \\
\\
These loose cardigans--green, grisled, and gold-- \\
Depicting a fat man commanding \\
Enslaved animals to walk in the snow \\
While he laughs a sadistic \\
\textit{Ho-Ho-Ho}; \\
\\
These moronic prints on synthetic wool, \\
Of Kanye bein' Kanye, that everyone bought \\
because, \textit{hey, pop-culture is cool}; \\
\\
And here I am, obliged, ignominious and ridiculous, \\
In this sweater, by Christmas \textit{tradition}. \\
\\
\textit{Bah-Hum-Bug} \\
