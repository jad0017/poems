\\
People are weird. \\
You can't trust what they'll say. \\
\\
You'll sit in a bar, \\
or class, \\
or even my car, \\
and you'll hear shit. \\
\\
They'll swear it all makes sense; \\
That you're just out of context. \\
\\
But you'll hear them clear and oddly pronounced \\
that they'll leave a breadcrumb trail of condoms for their spouse. \\
\\
Or they could be more vague \\
like James who probably abstains, \\
since he insists that his dick isn't \\
a sprinkler slinging sperm \\
all over a field of drunken grass. \\
\\
Yes, people are weird. \\
They'll say anything these days. \\
\\
Because you really need a side chick \\
for when your main is bein' a bitch. \\
\\
And never wear shorts when you're in an ally sucking dick. \\
Because you'll get caught in the moment and never want to quit. \\
And the maginal padding provided by pants will really help your knees. \\
\\
And, you know, while you're at it, \\
stop being afraid of fucking bees. \\
\\
Your knees are fucked up \\
and you worry about bees? \\
\\
The fuck is wrong with you? Jeez. \\
People are weird. \\
