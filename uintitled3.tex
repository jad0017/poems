\\
Death's Little Sister follows me. \\
She makes my heart burst \\
dyeing the space I once occupied \\
a horrifyingly natural red. \\
\\
No demon, beast, nor martyre of hell \\
quite piques me so well as she. \\
With great rituals in crowds \\
of commonality and solitude \\
at shadow's helm. \\
\\
Debauchery in droves \\
---her vice--- \\
handling bouquet after bouquet \\
of grousome roses to the living. \\
\\
Death's Little Sister follows me. \\
She's there by my bed \\
like a bad draught of wine \\
racing my heart and whirling my world. \\
\\
She's there by my side \\
with a hand on my shoulder \\
pushing me down; \\
staggering my step. \\
\\
She's there in my lungs; \\
a stale beat as my abdomine \\
contracts producing \\
waterfalls on porcelin rocks. \\
\\
No demon, beast, nor martyre of hell \\
haunts me as well \\
forever my cypress-wound curse. \\
