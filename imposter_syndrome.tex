I know I wear khakis like I was born in them \\
but my soul dies every time I slip into them. \\
I'm stabbing kites into my chest \\
as my last saving grace \\
to shield me from the world \\
as the moon casts shadows \\
on my mirrored self \\
and I fail to see who I was, \\
who I am, and who I wanna be \\
while the beast in my ear offers heresy. \\
\\
We're dancing by the willow's side \\
like it's going to make the Eldritch \\
come back tonight and suddenly \\
we're mapping peace into chaos \\ % cha-os
as the beast and I really start to hit it off. \\
\\
The skull on my desk isn't just a decoration \\
it's a declairation of my disposition, see, \\
my flesh is falling off and I really need caffeine \\
to bring my back alive but it's not working \\ % work-ing
and I'm wondering... \\ % wonder-ing

Just when did I become an expert? \\
Because I feel like I'm a jester \\ % jest-er
juggling all these people's issues. \\
I've got to have a screw loose \\
because my face-mug is facing me \\
it's talking with its beady little eyes \\
staring into me, whispering: \\ % whisper-ing
\\
\textit{You're never good enough.} \\
\textit{You've never been good enough.} \\
\textit{You'll never be good enough.} \\
\\
\textit{Fucking die.} \\
