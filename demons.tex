\textbf{Demons} \\
\\
Stricken and caustic \\
my mind lay deranged \\
\\
My reflection is broken \\
but the mirror still stands \\
\\
What cost must I pay \\
where death has walked \\
before my time \\
one silver to cross \\
the river, Acheron. \\
\\
Where does my executioner sit? \\
By girdle and stone; \\ % leather girdle and stone wheel to sharpen blade
should I pay my debt clean \\ % tipping the executioner to make the death
or dirty to atone? \\ % quick and painless
\\
The lilac has found me. \\
surrounds me. \\
confounds me. \\
\\
I now know what it means \\
to lose myself in others \\
and take in their screams. \\
\\
The contour has broken. \\
My heart aches to bleed \\
and drown where my body \\
cannot be found. \\
\\
War has arrived and knocked at my door. \\
The silence has broken \\
%my dissonance is no more. \\ % This doesn't make sense... shouldn't dissonance grow?
my dissonance growns more. \\

Am I called to hunt  \\
in the forest \\
where the devils dance \\
with the young--- \\

Has Salem's time come? \\
\\
Or must I lie and accept \\
that Thanatos has won? \\
\\
Stricken and caustic \\
my mind lay deranged \\
\\
My reflection is broken \\
and I die all the same. \\
