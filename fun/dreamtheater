As I Am
Don't
Tell me what's in
Tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight
Isn't your life
It isn't your right
To take the only thing that's
Mine
Proven over time
It's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines
Are clearly defined
Never lose sight of
Something you believe in
Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog
I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you
To those who understand I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand take me as I am
Not under your command I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan Take me as I am
As I am
Still
Running uphill
Swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so
Fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
Slow down
You're thinking too much
Where is your soul
You cannot touch
The way I
Play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way
Of all that I believe in
Takin' in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog
I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you
To those who understand I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand take me as I am
Not under your command I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan take me as I am
This Dying Soul
Hello Mirror so glad to see you my friend it's been a while
Searching Fearless where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial
Face yourself man
Brace yourself and trace your hell back
You've been blinded living lie a one way cold existence all the while
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes you long lost child
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul
Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you
Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage
Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate
Living on your own by twenty one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue
Possessive obsessions selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments
Passing all the blame
Living out a life of decadence
Acing without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most
Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you
A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking and shaking and left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making a change to fix this dying soul
Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall
Come to me my friend (Listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (Help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (Give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)
Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone
Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help I know you can
Be at one with God and man
Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall
Dedicated to Bill W and all of his friends
Endless Sacrifice
Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness
Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return
Again
Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day
I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice
Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles
Burn
Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still
You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice
Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart
Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance
All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream
Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice
Honor Thy Father
We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter
You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see
You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
Gimme time to re-charge my batteries
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan
On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me
Never in my life have I seen someone
So Ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
I tried your four bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again
Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song
On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me
Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Watch where you walk
Don't you dare cross the crooked step
Watch the way you talk
Don't cross the crooked step
This is a regret that you make
we're still connected
This is a regret that you make
I want my family back
and there's something you take
You can't have it I'm sorry for you but it's too late
Mistakes like thisYou don't make
Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you
You make someAnd they'll get to you
You don't love anybody
I gave you money I gave you a car I took you in
It's not okay son
but don't that mean something
Do I admire people too much
NoYou should do better
That disappoints you
God damn regrets
You deserve to die alone for what you have done
God damn regrets
Don't deny it
You cocksucker I know you're here
Don't deny it
I want you to know I hate your fucking guts
The biggest regret in my life
I wish you'd fucking die
I've let my love go
I'm your blood I'm your family
Is that you
You're not my family not anymore
The fucking regrets
When your own flesh and blood renounces you
What did I do
you have no choice but to renounce them
What did I do
On and on and on and on it goes
Chauvinistic heartless selfish cold
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this shit on me
Never in my life have I seen someone
So fucking blind to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Vacant
Hey you Hey you
I'm right here
Conscience fading
Can't get through
Oh Lord
Helpless
Confused
Head swayed
Eyes glazed
And mine teared
She's losing control
What can I do
Her vacant eyes
Black holes
Am I losing you
Stream Of Consciousness
In The Name Of God
How can this be
Why is he the chosen one
Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun
Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong
Come bleed the beast
Follow me it won't be long
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God
Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination
Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey
Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in Holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God
Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins
They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God
Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God
Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God
Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God
Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God
Justifying violence
Citing from the Holy Book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God
Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence
Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord
he is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored
he hath loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword
his truth is marching on
Descent Of The Nomacs
Dystopian Overture
The Gift Of Music
Far in the distant future
Beyond the pages of our time
Cold-blooded wicked tyrants
Threaten the freedom of mankind
Corruption lust and greed
Define the new nobility
Changing the course of history
Across the vast North Empire
Most people struggle to survive
Living a meek existence
While their secluded leader thrives
We are living day to day
Forced to bare the lion's share
People just don't have the time for music anymore
And no one seems to care
My friends I've seen the chosen one
Our quest for freedom has begun
He will be the answer to our prayers
There walks a god among us
Who's seen the writing on the wall
He is the revolution
He'll be the one to save us all
My brother Gabriel is all the hope we need
Shining like a beacon in the night
Shepherd of Ravenskill
A reason to believe
Music is the gift he brings
The songbird stops to listen when he sings
The Answer
I don't pretend to have the answer
Never said I held the key
But somehow they see a light inside of me
Am I not the man who I was meant to be
As the people gather round me
I never felt so all alone
Is this the chance to be someone
My moment in the sun
Why am I afraid of facing the unknown
They are finding faith in me and they believe I'm the one to set them free
A Better Life
As fearless leader of the Ravenskill militia
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins
My brother's gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our hope our pride
A catalyst for change
Still the fires of revolution burn within my eyes
On this perilous road to freedom
He's our one and only guide
For many years I've seen our people starve and suffer
How many more will die
Before we stand and fight
They ask me Arhys
Could things be any tougher
The answer's no surprise
Yes you bet your life
Now the fires of revolution won't burn for evermore
I see liberty in our future
And it's one worth fighting for
We all long for a better life
Like a dream that can't be denied
This is the moment
Now is the time
Freedom if we live or if we die
I shall give him a better life
I swore this vow to my dying wife
Sure she would not survive
Peacefully
She slipped away
The meaning in my life
Was born that day
And so I found the strength to carry on
With this crusade
It is my fate
Evangeline
You lived a life of misery and pain
Evangeline
I'll never let your memory die in vain
Evangeline
My heavy heart still bleeds
I dedicate my life to set him free
And I will carry on to plant the seeds
I promise in the name of our new son
This battle won't be over until it's won
Lord Nafaryus
How the rumors are spreading like vines
Of a man who has been glorified
News finds its way
To the empire one day
Where the envious ruler resides
Should I fall for the stories I hear
Is he really a threat I should fear
Such a foolish young man
Doesn't seem to understand
So let me be perfectly clear
He may have them inspired
Eating out of his hand
But he'll never be ruler of this land
For myself I must see
What the hype is about
I admit I'm intrigued
I've heard the whispering of revolution
I know the aim of your plan
You think insurgency is your solution
And put your faith in one man
His decision is made
So his journey begins
Off to the edge of The Realm
To meet the savior
In the coming days
They'll announce his grace
And he'll ask to be amazed
As a symbol of power and might
It will make for a breathtaking sight
In a massive display
With his family and guards by his side
Arabelle who means the world to me
Our loyal son my heir your future king
And Faythe I treasure more than all the
diamonds in my crown
It isn't hard to see
I couldn't be more proud
Into the far off reaches of the land
To witness this great spectacle first hand
Is Gabriel the God he claims to be
I guess we'll see
Yes we shall see
A Savior In The Square
We have come to hear him sing
To see this gift your savior brings
A crowd has grown
And all are mesmerized
But silence quickly falls
As Lord Nafaryus arrives
Please don't stop on my account
Show us what we've heard so much about
In peace
We gather here today
Don't make him ask again
Do as my father says
Brother worry not today
I will share my music
And they will soon be on their way
They only know the noise machines
So I'll treat them all to sonic ecstacy
Never in my dreams could I deserve
To ever see a vision quite like her
Then unexpectedly
I'm taken by surprise
An angel just appeared before my eyes
When Your Time Has Come
When your time has come
And you're looking toward the light
All that really matters
Is what you leave behind
So let your heart be free
Keep your spirit burning bright
Set down the stones you carry
Take the weight off your mind
When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know
Which choice is right
In this fleeting life
We can sometimes lose our way
But night is always darkest
Just before the new day
When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know which choice is right
This very moment
Was always meant to be
I never noticed
But all at once I see
On the worst of days when I felt most alone
With no one to share the secret that I hide
I grew numb to all the emptiness inside
But now I've found my home
Act Of Faythe
I never knew they spent their days in rags
While I enjoy the life they'll never have
Yet deep within their eyes
Hope still survives
And they don't seem to think this world's so bad
Even as they gather in the square
They know a better life exists out there
With unity and pride
Faith stays alive
How can I pretend that I don't care
I have always felt alone
Living like a stranger inside of my own home
Maybe now's the time to greet the wings of change
Could my destiny
Be right in front of me
As a child behind the palace walls
Often times I'd search its secret halls
And hoping I would find
A treasure cast aside
I came upon the greatest gift of all
My music player
My private paradise
My music player
A refuge I must hide
Been lost at sea forever
Adrift and far away
Now finally for the first time
I know I found my way
Three Days
The admiration
The applause and the cheers
I am impressed
You've brought us all to tears
To think I didn't notice
The way you looked at her
Now step down from your throne
And let me bring you back to earth
Need I remind you
I am the ruler here
Don't overlook that fact
Swearing allegiance
To anyone but me
No I won't put up with that
Hide and protect him
Send him away
I'll never play this game
Stand by your savior
One thing remains
I'll find him just the same
Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus
Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus
He'll surrender on his own
If not there'll be hell to pay
I'll tear down this city stone by stone
You only have three days
Send home the rebels
Call off the fight
In no unceartain terms
Should you refuse me
Fear for your lives
Ravenskill shall burn
Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus
Pray for help
Kneel before Nefaryus
With this frightening decree
Nafaryus departs
They're left to weigh the gravity
Of his threatening remarks
Judgement day will soon arrive
In only three days time
Will Gabriel get out of this alive
This remains the question on their minds
The Hovering Sojourn
Brother Can You Hear Me
Brother can you hear me
Your life is in my hands
I will not surrender
Never yield to his demands
If we stand together
We will never fall
Brother we're the answer to your call
Brother can you hear me
You must not be afraid
I will march beside you
Have no fear
Be strong
Be brave
We sing the song of freedom
Our voices will resound
Brother we will never let you down
On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price that we must pay
For every choice we make
Freedom is a reason
To stand up or give in
But someone has to lose
And someone has to win
Brother can you hear me
I am not afraid
I will not forsake you
I'll be strong and I'll be brave
I sing the song of freedom
My courage knows no bounds
Brother now I stand on solid ground
Brother I will never let you down
Never let you down
A Life Left Behind
I never knew
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes
All of this time
While I was sleeping
The world changed around me
Now I've never felt more alive
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up
Fate found a way
To bring them together
Once and forever
And won't let them go
Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
Her life has new meaning
I lost her a long time ago
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I'm waking up
I'll plan to return well disguised
Make sure that I'm not recognized
Tomorrow a new sun will rise
And somehow I'll find you
Nothing will stand in my way
Soon I will see you again
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I will never look back
I'm waking up
You'll be her shadow as she moves my son
But she can never know you're there
She is alone and rebel guards are everywhere
I'll keep her safe from all danger
Won't let her out of my sight
Did I fail to mention my honest intentions
This is the chance I deserve
Heed my words justice will be served
Ravenskill
Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way
Please excuse me
Sir can you help me
Where can I find this man
Sorry can't speak
Someone is waiting
Yes I understand
As her will
Starts to fade
And all but disappears
Like a ghost
Suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear
I'm your friend
Trust me don't be scared
I am looking for your father and I promise
I can help
Now take my hand
We haven't time to spare
Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity
Behind the stranger's eyes
Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise
My intentions are faithful
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again
You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
Why would I trust you
It's not like that
I can't go back
Hope fades away
With each passing second
Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way
Gabriel
I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day
I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand
With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes alive
Chosen
Her words ring true
Her message clear
How can he hear
Through all the noise and dissonance
I've seen a sign
That he can change
If given just a chance
Against all hope
We found a way
And it is all because she trusts in me
Why have a gift
You can't embrace
When all you need is faith
And there's a reason now I see
The reason I've been chosen
She sees the light inside of me
A reason to believe
But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home
And there's a reason now I see
The path that he has chosen
He fears the light inside of me
In the absence of song
He's forgotten right from wrong
Our voices will release him
He's refused to listen far too long
I'm convinced beyond a doubt
There can be no other way
He just has to hear me out
There's so much I need to say
But I can't climb this mountain without you
No I can't face this on my own
With you by my side we will open his eyes
And the truth will deliver us home
A Tempting Offer
Trustful boy
Unaware who's watching
Open the door
I am right behind you
Don't resist me child
There's no use in fighting
We'll be here a while
Do you recognize me
Look into my eyes
I'm the face of freedom
When daddy does arrive
He's in for a surprise
How dare you step inside my home
His life is in my hands
You monster leave my son alone
You do know who I am
Your love for him is strong
He's just a boy
He's done no wrong
This fight's not his to lose
I have everything you want
Your next decision
Will decide his fate
So listen to the words I have to say
Give up The Chosen One
And you will guarantee your son
Lives the life you never had
Wealth and prosperity
Beyond what you have ever seen
And best of all Xander will be free
He'll never want again
It's such an easy choice
Just think about your son
And I won't have to stand
In Faythe's dark shadow anymore
I am through with being pushed aside
Tired of fighting for my father's pride
Take the evening to decide
Digital Discord
The X Aspect
Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make
But who am I
If not the one
Who's meant to keep him safe
Is trust and loyalty still justified
If I deny him of a better life
Gabriel
Has always been
The strength I call upon
But nothing breaks
A father's will
To do what must be done
Should I turn my back on him
Abandon all our plans for revolution
Will hope and freedom die by morning light
Evangeline
I swore to you
To love and guide our son
Destiny
Has shown his face
And now the time has come
Desperation blinds me
And through these bloodstained eyes I see the light
A better life is worth this sacrifice
A New Beginning
Father I implore you
Don't believe a word
He is not the enemy
That is just absurd
You may see his talent
As some kind of threat
But I know we were meant to be
From the day we met
Give us both a chance
For a new beginning
Nothing would mean more to me
He is just a man
Can't you show him mercy
Sympathy and strength go hand in hand
This man's a fraud and a hoax
He'll only shatter your hopes
Saddest of all is to watch how you fall
For this person who you hardly know
Ignorant and stubborn
You have no respect
Not just for your flesh and blood
But all who you protect
Listen without judgement
Keep an open mind
If you can not see the truth
You're the one who's blind
We don't stand a chance
That is his opinion
Mother can you talk to him
Try to understand
How they must be feeling
Misery's to know what might have been
Why would I ever concede
To listen to this fool How can you be so naive
You must be living in a world of make believe
Do you really think this charlatan is who he claims to be
Not long ago there was a time and place
You too possessed the same desires as Faythe
You knew how it felt to feel invisible
Music calmed your soul just like a drug
Remember Bug
Father is it true
Bug was always you
Finally I can reveal
How music makes me feel
Now you understand
Why I was hiding
This changes everything
I will grant the chance
For a new beginning
In the end the final word rests with me
The Road To Revolution
He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything may not turn out as planned
If love's a risk
It's worth the chance
I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road
Arhys time is running out
What will your decision be
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline
On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation when you stand for your beliefs
When the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back be the man I want to be
Change my mind
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine
Open eyes
Help me see which choice is right
2285 Entr'acte
Moment Of Betrayal
Brace yourself my brother
I have breaking news
The Noise Machines lie still tonight
There's no time to lose
No more threats of bloodshed
No more pain and fear
Ravenskill will brave the storm
Our victory is near
You are acting very strange
Nervous and on edge
I will be a voice for change
Brother give me strength
Burning rose secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death blood revenge
Moment of betrayal
I have sworn to live and die
By the warrior's code
Never leave a man behind
May God redeem my soul
I will give you what you need
My brother for my son
The guilt and shame will burden me
Until my days are done
Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky
He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide
Burning rose secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death blood revenge
Moment of betrayal
He will be defenseless
I'll look on say I put up a fight
There will be no witness
They will call you a hero tonight
Burning rose secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death blood revenge
Moment of betrayal
Threats and lies changing sides
Moment of betrayal
Risking all savior's fall
Moment of betrayal
Heaven's Cove
Under the glow of the midnight moon
Where the stars touch the sky
Stand the long forgotten remains of a time gone by
Heaven's Cove was a wonderous site
Once a beautfiul place
Now an empty shell like a memory that time erased
As the pivotal moment draws closer
Every shadow and whisper ignite
Music will rise like a phoenix from the ashes on this night
Begin Again
I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
And now I can
Begin again
I once believed
Our fate was sealed
But now at last the truth has been revealed
In an instant life could change
And now and then
Begin again
I know that I am meant for something more
That life beyond these walls
Has greater things in store
When I heard his voice I realized
I'd never be the same
Instantly I knew my life had changed
I dream of peace
Above all else
To share a world where we could be ourselves
We must learn to rise above the past
Before we can at last
Begin again
The Path That Divides
The evening stars shine brightly
Over heaven's cove
As night descends in silence
The fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation
Arhys hears his brother's voice
As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side
I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done
My blood for my son
It's not too late
I won't betray him
I knew the day had come
And you could be tempted
To give up The Chosen One
And finally end this
Do anything for your son
A terminal weakness
But now you're as good as done
I didn't have a choice
And I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice
And fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth
I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you
Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave
On the path that divides
You were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight
I found courage and strength
In the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies
On the path that divides
You dare defy your prince
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray
Two hungry warriors
Clash in the shadows of the night
But there's a cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope
Cost him his very life
Machine Chatter
The Walking Shadow
What have you done
You murderer
My father's dead
Your day will come
Don't hold your breath
The night's still young
Confront your death
Like father like son
Who's this I see
Approaching me
The Chosen One
Drawing closer pace by pace
The walking shadow hides its face
Never aware of the looming attack
Like stepping right into a trap
As his weapon
Find its victim
Mortified he's shocked to find the shadow is Faythe
My Last Farewell
Angels above
Have you deceived my eyes
Be still my love
I won't leave your side
All my life
I have walked alone
Now I've found my home in you
Only I'm too late
Have I wandered into someone's nightmare
This is more than any heart can bare
You stole my brother's life
How many more have to die
Before you will open your eyes
Don't leave me now
Hold on for one more breath
Stay strong somehow
This can't be the end
All your life
You have walked alone
Now I am your home
So take my hand and don't let go
Crushing pain and crippling grief
Nothing like I've ever felt
God above and souls beneath
Hear my last farewell
Losing Faythe
My foolish pride
My selfish heart
Lost in the dark
Blinded by my arrogance
And now you beg for one last breath
And I'm the one to blame
There's a reason now I see
The reason you have chosen
To find the light inside of me
If only I believed
Here I am
Don't be afraid
I will never let you slip away
Look my way
You must be brave
Find the strength to live for one more day
I will keep from losing Faythe
I will ask for grace
And hope will find a way
Like a candle's dying flame
With forgiving eyes
She starts to drift away
Gabriel my son
I see the tide is turning
Can The Chosen One
Keep her fire burning
I would trade my life
Just for one last moment
Use your gift I beg
May life begin again
May life begin again
Whispers On The Wind
If I still had something left
I'd surely use my gift
To give her one more breath
To see her smile again
And yet my gift is gone
Along with all her dreams
It vanished with a scream
My fragile voice has all but disappeared
I've nothing left to give
The words I wish I'd said
Just whispers on the wind
And now all hope is dead
Hymn Of A Thousand Voices
Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain
A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
A symphony of mercy for their savior
Too tired to fight
And as the chorus grew
A thousand hearts beat true
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark
Hope came shining through
Amazingly the savior found his voice
And all together they rejoiced
Glorious sound
Guide her tonight
Out of the darkness
Into the light
Merciful song
Set her soul free
Unbind the chains of endless sleep
Choirs on high
Grant her new life
Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace
Music has shown her the way
She lives today
Our New World
Like your father once said
Life is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen
So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world
I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever
In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world
We'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world
Together we'll build a new world
A wondrous world
We'll build a new world
A bold new world
Power Down
Astonishing
Brother can you hear me
His life is in your hands
He is just a child and still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
That freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down
Father
I will make you proud
Rest in peace
I always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see
The reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be
Because of you I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew
On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn
When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal a humbled man
My prince my son
You got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven on this day
People can you hear us
Peace has been restored
The silence has been broken
Music reigns forever more
We sing a song of freedom
Together we are bound
People we shall never hold you down
We will build our world on common ground
And we'll live once more
Eternally
In harmony
Our lives will be
Astonishing
Again
