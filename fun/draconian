Storm Of Damnation Starfire Burns For My Black Misanthropy.
Heavy Lies The Crown.
Clouds of defiance.
Over mankind they gently weep.
To this verge I collapse.
While god stays sound asleep.
Losing the balance.
I'm losing the hold of it all.
Make these trembling ghosts.
Not chase me anymore.
Stars shine brighter.
Yet heavy lies the crown.
Distant still clutching.
In the blackness of it all.
And the candle burns out.
As I touch your heart.
For treading the footsteps.
Of many sorrows passed.
And I yearn for the sun to set.
For the curtain to fall.
This is all I am.
All I have.
Fallen from luster.
To nothingness and scorn.
And fall dark veil.
Softly through the morn.
A haunted starless sky.
Fragile and oh so deep.
The dying softly wakes.
And smiles in painless peace.
Fallen from luster.
To nothingness and scorn.
So fall dark veil.
Softly through the morn.
And the drumless beat.
It dissolves into the mire.
But you are sleeping.
And a vacuum to my fire.
And I yearn for the sun to set.
For the curtain to fall.
This is all I am.
All I have.
Fallen from luster.
From nothingness and scorn.
And fall dark veil.
Softly through the morn.
A haunted starless sky.
Fragile and oh so deep.
The dying softly wakes.
And smiles in painless peace.
The Wretched Tide.
We're leaving today.
After dust-ridden shutters close.
And heartbeats they rush.
Then to cease in your embrace.
These scars through-out the night.
Left no more fighting in us.
No tears to fill the void.
In a place even devils fled.
The wretched tongues.
Wording their pain onto me.
Until even tide enters.
There's no place out of here.
or grace to lift me up every molecule.
Whispered to make peace with this unreality.
I felt I was slipping downwards.
Into darkness.
and in darkness I stayed.
Until sadness closed its eyes.
Ships passing in the silvery night.
Carrying this vicious benevolent heart.
And in sadness we part.
In the dark of you in the dark of me.
Release these hearts from the turmoil.
Tired and cold.
A tale since eons of old.
So elusive this intemperance of escape.
So much has fallen and is falling still.
Into the hands of the ever maddening crowd.
So we're leaving today.
As dust-ridden shutters close.
To site that glimmer of hope.
And breathe if only for awhile.
These stars that turned the tide.
Left no more fighting in us.
No hope to find the dawn.
In a place even specters dwell.
Ships passing in the silvery night.
Carrying this vicious benevolent heart.
And in sadness we part.
In the dark of you in the dark of me.
Release these hearts from the turmoil.
Only love before they drown.
Tired and cold.
A tale since eons of old.
So elusive this intemperance of escape.
So much has fallen and is falling still.
Into the hands of the ever maddening crowd.
Pale Tortured Blue.
On my naked back.
A dance of the nocturnal sun.
The tall grass crawls around me.
In adoration bowing can I find you in your dark.
Can you find me in your heart.
There is a fallen statue in the wilderness.
It has found its way to your dreams.
Haunting the waking hours.
In nights color with eyes like rain.
The shades beseech you.
My love increases you.
And summer freezes you into me.
The cold fire suits you.
A pale tortured blue blistering through.
A lifeless lover was the high mountain.
Where we tried to reach the stars.
The moon the ways beyond.
It was the purest love of all.
I will raise a statue in the wilderness.
It will find its way to your dreams.
This will haunt you forever.
In nights color with eyes like rain.
Yet I collect the stars you wept.
Keeping them as my own.
To be lost in your eyes.
For all the sadness that we kept.
And I fail to realize it's you.
The cold suits you.
A pale tortured blue blistering through.
When there is peace within myself.
And everything else.
A pale tortured blue blistering through.
Stellar Tombs.
A place where daylight aches.
It's all unreal to you.
A sunset calls me here.
I swear to love it's true.
So alien this vaulted screen.
And patterns form into contours.
The dark around me as dense as matter.
A stellar quake fills the astral space.
How dare you not to see.
My tears are gifts to you.
A heart you must set free.
How dare you not believe.
Became I freeze in the warmth in the glow of Helios.
Sweat in the heart of summers drained.
And radiant life to falter and beautiful tears to dry.
I'm gracefully bowing In horror.
Waterless like the ocean.
Drizzling like the deserts.
Come emerge and wallow.
Pretend like nothing at all.
Along the whirlwinds in your head.
A place where daylight aches.
It's all unreal to you.
A world we must set free.
I swear to love it's true.
Petrified spirit dilated stare.
I'm piercing through these icy shackles.
Somehow cast around this nebula.
Unwilling to enter my birth.
Would you take my hand and follow through the ether.
Would you sweat and dance in winters bloom.
For radiant life to falter and beautiful tears to dry.
I'm gracefully bowing In sorrow.
Waterless like the ocean.
Drizzling like the deserts.
Come emerge and wallow.
Pretend like nothing at all.
Along the whirlwinds in your head.
along the whirlwinds in your head.
Frailty and strength marry and dissolve.
And the sky fills up with poetry and song.
Into the soothing black we go.
No Lonelier Star.
Floating imperceptible cinders.
Back and forth a stare over the cosmic veil.
As a star is dying nuclear winters coming.
Oh entangled earth distant eyes ablaze.
Interweave forever into your hunger.
As gravity collapses and light torn asunder.
Sowing the seeds.
Then burning the fields.
We are burning the fields.
Then sowing the seeds.
Nothing lives or dies here.
Just calumnies of matter onto the dark.
It slips through our fingers.
Unperceiving the emptiness.
We are burning the stellar fields.
I rise through debris and the dust.
Who is this sun.
A always spoke to the stars.
A rise through debris and the dust.
Who was this sun.
A always spoke to the stars.
Release me from myself.
Fading back into the womb.
That stellar ethereal tomb.
Just waiting for my moment to matter.
And consciousness slept inside the stars.
And we must remember that we forget.
There is an immunity boundless ahead of it all.
Further always further from here.
These memories are continuing.
Ever onward before the dawn.
Seeing as time we can't escape.
I'm drifting and fading and choking in here.
These nightmares are continuing.
Aching glimpses always in hiding.
I'm begging begging you for hope.
I stumble through the rugged door.
The crater of my being.
Watching this heart graciously beating.
Until it beats no more.
Interweave forever into your hunger.
As gravity collapses and light torn asunder.
We are burning the stellar fields.
I rise through debris and the dust.
Who is this god.
Dusk Mariner.
No light finds me.
Perish like the setting sun.
No truth defies me.
Unburdened use the fallen one.
I'd give you my love.
But it's freezing cold.
My lips ever sealed.
And the things I have done.
Are slowly growing old.
Yet dying to be healed.
No heart guides me.
Frozen in the depths below.
No fear leaves me.
I'm haunted by a distant soul.
She gives me her voice.
She gives me her soul.
Yet demons in my view.
As fear breaks down.
I weep to understand.
I was already you.
Living in a circle of decay.
Where morn remains the night.
Under these starless skies.
Love out of sight.
Breathe carelessly.
Be all you feared as a child.
See it's only me.
And not the heavens .
Coming down on you.
No light finds me.
She gave me her voice.
It warms my soul.
This angel in my view.
As fear breaks down.
I weep to understand.
I was already you.
We were walking in circles of decay.
Where morn remains the night.
Under these starlit skies.
Love marks our flight.
Farewell.
Dishearten.
All the tears that you cry won't awaken me.
When the devils lay dormant inside.
The blood in my veins has forsaken me.
They die.
Disheartened and cold.
And scars upon my soul.
I lost you in the silence.
Bleeding through the walls.
A sorrow came that ceased to leave.
And took you from my arms.
The dawn a promise of beauty.
But in dusk our rose will die.
I'm forgetting how to face.
The sadness of your eyes.
Further I linger with nothing to give.
Faster I'm choking on the poison I breathe.
Spare me your judgment and spare me your woes.
This burden upon me is ruthless and cold.
Disheartened and cold.
And thorns upon my soul.
I found you in the nothingness.
Haunted by the past.
Too late I heard the howling.
That broke your heart at last.
The moon a promise of solace.
But the sun a promise of scorn.
I'll cry for you no longer.
You don't need me anymore.
We're too tired to sleep.
And these bodies confound.
As coldness awaits us.
The deeper I stumble.
Into your arms.
The harder we suffer.
As the empire falls.
Strange eyes are gazing.
Your hissing smouldering tongue.
Your reflection is broken.
Yet the mirror is mine.
I found you in the silence.
Bleeding through the walls.
A sorrow came that ceased to leave.
And took you from my arms.
Rivers Between Us.
Where is the world I saw in your eyes.
It lived through the night then whispered goodbye.
The cuts in your skin and the red in my eyes.
This winter inside is crushing me now.
I am alone I am scorn I can't remember to forget you.
I just weather the storm.
The love that I had it drowned with the tide.
stirring the waters where heartslay bare.
The cuts in your skin and the red in your eyes.
Enfolding this shame into despair.
Let me take the noose from our necks and carry us home.
Still so alive even after you die transcending with time.
We're just two cripples who fail to belong.
Yes we are two cripples but we need to hold on.
From this flesh my spirit longs to break away.
Did you ever feel this cosmic circumstance was never enough.
Wake me slowly if ever at all.
Wake me slowly or watch me fall.
The life that I had is gone with the tide Watch me fall.
Another deception I whisper goodbye.
The cuts in my flesh the red in your eyes Watch me fall.
These demons inside they die with me now.
The Marriage Of Attaris.
You cannot hide from a grace already perceived.
That is a fierce grace indeed.
And you cannot hide a tree that is growing.
Valiantly stretching for the stars.
Angles weep as they count your scars.
These rivers of blood.
Fields scorched to ash.
Lament of life a love song.
We all share our sorrows.
In light suspended.
Smiling at the ever dying sun.
Flakes of snow are melting.
On the top of your eyes.
Shedding heaven tears.
The tracks we left.
Almost buried now.
This is a beautiful place.
Here Cassiel wedded winter.
So man could grieve.
So man could see.
These trees are dark and old.
In solitude unified.
Licking the ground tasting the rough.
Cold wind so man could breath.
There is no masquerade in your silence.
Just pages filled of winter.
The seed of ascendance are hiding.
Let's drench the hour.
These wastelands of dusk.
Oceans bled and barren.
Lament of life a love-song.
The only death awoken.
A fear of transcendence.
Keeps us from the rapture of one.
And the blood of the sphere.
It emptied their mouths.
Drowning the world.
Hammer me down as pillars.
Veiled from creation unchanging.
Patching the holes and the cracks.
Tightening the rope around your necks.
And we see mankind aimlessly breeding.
Desperately bleeding.
Erasing you erasing me from here.
So tired so tired.
I need to feel the freezing blue.
Leave me here.
Let the coming of spring.
Carry me back to earth.
Leave me here.
With Love And Defiance.
Bonus Track.
Awake in slumbering world.
As structures outside cave in.
So harbor us sweet sorrow.
This lonely exquisite hollow.
Oh mother on conscious dark sails.
In your theatre of sirens hears us.
They see weeping the newborn horizon.
We are here split into two.
With love and defiance.
From the distance they came .
Covered in ash.
There is no hope in this lifeless void.
Which aired of parasite tongues.
Oh mother on conscious dark sails.
In your theatre of sirens hears us.
They see weeping the newborn horizon.
We are here split into two.
With love and defiance.
As a speck in the cosmic ocean you sail.
Trapped in ill-shaped tales with your grin.
And your gods of death.
They see weeping the newborn horizon.
We are here split into two.
With love and defiance.
We see them weeping newborn horizon.
They are here in spirit and flesh.
With love and defiance.
Seasons Apart.
Take my hand Follow me through tranquillity.
Stay with me you will see ardour where shadows grow.
Feel my heart relieve your hope of this fading love.
Winter came far too soon but still the flowers bloom.
And winter came too soon and will the flowers die.
Bow down their heads under the cold cold sky.
In a world growing blind.
Who can expect me to see the pain that I caused.
It's the end for me and you.
Somehow we always knew.
because the guilt we had to hide.
Was right here at our side.
Heal my heart before it breaks.
Shade these austere lights.
Heal that wound that came to me.
Take me away from here.
Blindfold my eyes with thy grace.
The hope runs dry and the words of comfort.
I heard how they cracked.
We are breathing the shame I am the one to blame.
It's the end for me and you.
Somehow we always knew.
because the guilt we had to hide.
Was right here at our side.
When I Wake.
When I wake something inside me breaks.
Holding back the time until I sleep again.
Woe to me I'm forever lost to thee.
Woe to thee you're forever lost to me.
Let me sleep forever fade into the clouds.
Sublime emotion blowing in the wind.
Human thoughts like darkness to a flame.
Depart not as thy shadow came.
Your grave to be Fear a dark reality.
Your sympathy Lost or never meant to be.
My fright and the beating of my heart.
Close my eyes in silence and take me in your arms.
What have you done.
Reveal your heart.
Your suffocating silence.
Tears me apart.
So break this seal.
Where the quiet remains.
Where lovers mourn.
Broken and torn.
Only a wakeful silence of mourning shades.
Embodied forever into the stream.
When you sleep I sow what you reap.
But as you cry something inside me dies.
When I wake something inside me breaks.
In your eyes I watch how something dies.
What have you done.
Reveal your heart.
Your suffocating silence.
Tears me apart.
So break this seal.
Where the quiet remains.
Where lovers mourn.
Broken and torn.
Earthbound.
The sorrow of my soul earthbound and cold.
The tide will never turn.
I've been dead for years drowned in all my tears.
Have you forsaken me.
Frequent days of loss crawling to the cross.
The silence screams so loud.
Conquered by the sun my fate is done.
I'm pulling down the shroud.
Blazing through my eyes your tender disguise.
So far our of reach.
A life of dismay turns into grey.
Will you abandon me.
Here in the light it's pitch black night.
A fever on the rise.
Dying from within and reborn into sin.
I'm tearing up the sky.
Feel the world inside.
The ghost of me calling you.
Feel the world inside.
The ghost of me haunting you.
This sentient cage.
Cutting through time with a blunt smile.
Would you help me slit my wrists.
See me cry help me Die.
So frail the veil of life-so beautiful the face of death.
Suddenly reveries bloom into night's heavy drenching.
And life leaves you cold weary and old.
It's hard just to breathe.
You know me so well I'm going through hell.
Won't you please follow me.
Feel the world inside.
The ghost of me calling you.
Feel the world inside.
The ghost of me haunting you.
You cracked the ice and I wept.
You covered the sun and I slept.
You whispered the truth and I smiled.
You kissed my soul and I died.
Not Breathing.
You look so calm are you sleeping.
I'm closing the door to our illusion.
Where I lost myself in windswept dreams.
Two worlds so far apart.
I remember when I gave her my Eden.
From this dry land ardour now sleeps forsaken.
All the fear inside of me that I don't want her to see.
Will overwhelm this life and feed my hopeless strife.
And she came to me Insomnia.
Pounding in my chest.
Oh Lay my soul to rest.
Her heart like lacuna and lacerated wings.
Burning inside the echo of our dead union.
I'd like to rest inside the core of your very soul.
because your eyes are deeper much deeper than any well.
But she stayed with me Insomnia.
She paralyzed my heart.
And tore it apart.
I know I'm alive but not breathing.
Can you see me.
And you know how I tried Please believe me.
Can you hear me.
My eyes my soul The scars inside afflicted.
On my own by the world outside.
Where love lies starving on the ground.
I know I'm alive but not breathing.
Can you touch me.
And you know how I tried Please believe me.
Will you love me.
The Failure Epiphany.
I see your picture and all I feel is sorrow.
No hate no love No barren signs from above.
Can I be you for a while.
Let me see.
Can you be me for a moment.
Let it be Resolution.
Only regret seals the night where I uncover myself.
For those bygone days amid scenes of dread.
Resolve my love into sheer mercy.
God knows how many mornings I woke in torment.
Staring into the daytime void lost in fault and wonder.
Walking the fields where poisoned flowers swell.
Embittered into revulsion.
Confused I face how stern and devious is reality.
You conquered me with your delusion.
Then I vanished into blank pages already written.
Endurance and devotion kills each other.
And a demon enters our room.
And something dies.
Something dies inside of me.
Drowns in the vale of tears around me.
With a beacon of hope we could levitate like dancing on air.
And there in that moment we'll at last find solace.
Abundance shining greater than any dream.
The morning breaks so cold so cold.
My face it looks so old so old.
I rend my nails on the wall I've built around me.
Only in the shade can I be free.
Only in the shade I can be Me.
Morphine Cloud.
One single night one single day.
Before it all just sweeps away.
With the paradise I do not know.
Through the joy I never had.
I'm all alone on my isolated throne.
Why have you forsaken me.
The days outnumbered themselves into the grey.
And life cries a dream dies out into the blackness.
Stretches for an empty cup a chalice to collect the tears.
That I keep to myself.
I gaze upon the mystery this lovelorn identity.
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter.
This morphine cloud hanging over me.
Like a snow-white curtain.
This beautiful haze overruns me.
So I erase myself from you The cure for my sanity.
And here I am unwilling to forgive myself.
So lost in this remedy your spirit is haunting me.
Consumed by indifference.
I scream in your silence where shadows conceals me.
I'm cursed to search for you.
Oh feeble ungrateful my heart.
Paralyzed you drown with me.
Intoxicate this bitter reality.
Under the screens of apathy.
Oh feeble ungrateful my heart.
Paralyzed you drown with me.
Intoxicate this bitter reality.
Under the screens of apathy.
The dream died before it was born.
Innocence is lost And so am I.
But still I pretend to be strong.
Still I wonder where I belong.
You whisper to me gently in my sleep.
To leave this world behind.
And I gaze upon the mystery this lovelorn identity.
Frozen beyond the echoes of laughter.
Bloodflower.
I've made a good living by dying.
Endless wait grey solace ruling my mind.
Constrained by time and drained by the cold.
Still I found myself shivering under the rising sun.
You are the star you are the moon.
You are the soil where shadows bloom.
Casting a light which brings me peace.
Where the caverns of death will freeze.
The flower never grew.
But I love you just the same.
Even though like a bird you flew.
I will love you just the same.
I am the blood A fire in your soul.
And I will grow in landscapes so cold.
Oh how I feel you in every single detail.
As you lurk inside my troubled dreams.
There is no hope as long we walk this Earth.
But you should know my universe screams.
It screams for you.
I cry for you.
The flower never grew.
But I love you just the same.
Even though like a bird you flew.
I will love you just the same.
The Empty Stare.
My mind wandered off in the distance.
Where I am far from all that cages me.
All I could think of was death.
Her name disguised in silence.
Angelwings and ravenclaws.
The shredding of my soul.
Steeped in a lavender smile.
In thy eyes.
The womb of thy despair.
Embrace my life.
Within thy empty stare.
The overcast sky consoling me.
The fortitude within my grasp.
I think to myself I'm the sad clown.
Smiling reluctantly but crying behind the iron curtain.
These tears don't fall so easily.
In thy eyes.
The womb of thy despair.
Embrace my life.
Within thy empty stare.
Damn the illusion which fell upon me.
The bitter wine of reality poured all over my face.
And I despise what I've become.
Just a terrified man secluded and trapped in time.
In thy eyes.
The womb of thy despair.
Embrace my life.
Within thy empty stare.
Together let us roam.
Through endless dreams of night.
The moon as our limit.
And our souls as guiding light.
But how can I refuse my empathy to be resolute.
because it feels like I'm dying.
I have nothing to gain where there is nothing to lose.
September Ashes.
September begun with a goodbye to my heart.
The pictures you put in my head brought tears behind my icy hands.
Come closer Breathe my name and nothing more.
We are mere whisperings of a heartfelt elegy.
So when I scream for you do not answer me.
When I beg you to hold me just walk away.
