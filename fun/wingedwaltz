saw you there, in a field out that way.
sun was setting perfectly, adorned a mask.
visage outshining the day.
white dress; dancing, ablaze in your spotlight.
cicadas from a halo, gentle coercion.
forcing day into night.
forcing day into a night.
insect eclipse; frail wings that claim the heavens.
swarm eating bliss; a screeching symphony, came and went.
existence now a silhouette.
white dress; dancing, ablaze in your spotlight.
cicadas from a halo, gentle coercion.
forcing day into night.
lingering doubt of the end; no longer stands.
destruction; threads woven by a single hand.
we stitch our necks to the branch.
all thing undone, feet wave like pendulum.
six legs; crawling back.
to play me a song.
there is a light somewhere across the sea.
in brilliant stride glimmering star it seems.
speaking in a radiant pulse.
the wondrous path in cryptic gleam.
glimmering star it seems.
this is the code.
oh this i know.
illuminate to reveal a meaning somehow.
this fleeting sense of purpose.
it cascades.
dusting off the ash to become no longer afraid.
caught in trance.
purity with vantablack.
intertwined they dance.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
the watchful siren of perilous seas.
she laughs and sinks with me.
these stones and rope bound to my limbs.
like words never said again.
can we speak through waves of sight and sound,
or are we frail like a god uncrowned?
oh sleepless sun.
this is not our time.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
still caught in trance.
purity with vantablack.
intertwined they dance.
this is the code.
oh this i know.
illuminate to reveal a meaning somehow.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
no need to wonder why.
the blood flows in burning tides.
through the gutter that is your veins.
it keeps you awake, keeps you aflame.
the moment of respite, brought the splendor of hate.
premonition savored like the stranger's embrace.
sacred is nothing, give it all up.
the soul, even the body.
free-will destroyed.
fill the omnipresent void.
sacred is nothing, give it all up.
the soul, even the body.
free-will destroyed.
fall into insouciance.
an eathquake passes without attention.
sewers of red now turning grey.
nowhere is my shelter and home.
no need to worrie now.
you just have to let go.
release the soul, even the body.
you have to let go.
it keeps you awake, keeps you aflame.
plagues crafted, from gold.
silver, our light when darkness unfolds.
at the mercy of mournfull eyes.
awating the call.
bittersweet, effugy.
recited by us all.
a sanctuary of promises.
now left behind, abandon me.
the gift of warmth.
the sun surrounds.
to burn the memory.
a question ignite.
triggers a massive scale.
lifting every stone.
leaving nothing untouched.
feelings arouse to overwhelm.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
thoughts come close to deluge.
excess the presence for the fallen.
but still there are mountains unclimbed.
finding more pain to absorb.
to endure in hope, in hop for a meaning.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
decay in the dark unforgiving.
in these surroundings we are enslaved.
a question ignite.
triggers a massive scale.
lifting every stones.
envy for the ones that are living.
sympathy for the lost, for the lost and blackened.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
i share my tears for my fallen dreams.
that have lost their shape in shame.
a leash on my heart restraining me.
from reaching my dreams from within.
fading into the darkness.
searching to fill the void inside.
lying trembling on the floor.
demons crying out of the darkness below.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
a calm form of turmoil.
where do the demons live?
why do you fear the night.
am i the reason why you run and hide?
the darkness that lives in me.
can't leave, i will never be free.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
a calm form of turmoil.
where do the demons live?
unsought, a slumber for weary eyes.
bring forth all reflections, shrouding the aimless.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
embracing the cold,smiles lost in life's rapturous fold.
surrender at the waking hour.
hearts breaking with the dawn.
defeat, nostalgia beckoning.
to fall just for the stars.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
a mesmerizing spectacle.
the sun and i, are we no the same at all?
the burning wheel, the archetype.
of constant rise.
of constant fall.
unsought, a slumber for weary eyes.
bring forth all reflection, shrouding the aimless mind.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
an ode to those.
drowning in a sea of dreams.
the few that know.
the feeling.
something alway missing.
sheer pressure of existing.
when the emptiness comes.
it's hard to be whole.
you have been replaced, although.
it's bitterness that linger; in the place you once called home.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
the sight that captivates; amiss.
stealing a breath.
the eyes that resuscitate.
in the bloom of death.
no, you are never alone.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
you are not alone.
waiting for the feathers to fall.
wrag your feet, hang your head, walk along the walls.
in this labyrinth of thorns.
what is left? what is right?
where memories are born; just to lose their light.
the hand that led you here is not to blame.
the grip, the warmth, the smile, the fear.
something always missing.
the iron in the name.
it was always hidden, can't you see?
when i disappear, promise that you'll find me.
where the sky and ocean meet.
