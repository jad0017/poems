In the space of one night's darkness.
They have gathered somehow drawn.
To where sand and water meet.
To the place where nature mourns.
An army of one thousand souls.
Moved not by force of law.
But by an end of which they dreamt.
Returns to wade once more.
In the shallows but a prelude.
To the greatest icy depths.
Where neither shape nor shadow.
Can persist in one who's stepped.
Their unseeing eyes surveying.
Darkened scenes within their minds.
Now blissful soon will falter.
Laying bare what now it hides.
Once submerged they may awaken.
Briefly grasping moonlit skies.
But a crescent moon accompaniment.
Merely ushers in the tide.
Beneath horizons megalithic.
Rays of light's first wonder.
Shall reveal an ashen shoreline strewn.
With the prints of those pulled under.
The scene where the battle took place.
Now only whispers of that war remain.
Through fen damp and glade deep.
Crept the fog which was their bane.
Harkee the pain.
Welcome your death and the silence it makes.
As foe cleaves foe in the dawn.
Bodies are strewn and sinews are torn.
Blood hate and fear are his tools.
Shrouding their minds as they butcher like fools.
The frenzy of panic drives their steeds.
To a banquet grim for the crows to feed.
Amid the fury and sickness of struggle.
Ares strode unblemished and unseen.
Weaving his magic and dark illusion.
Upon a bloodied and wretched scene.
Harkee the pain.
Heralding death and the silence it makes.
As foe cleaves foe in the dawn.
Bodies are strewn and sinews are torn.
Blood hate and fear are his tools.
Shrouding their minds as they butcher like fools.
The frenzy of panic drives their steeds.
To a banquet grim for the crows to feed.
Though Ares had drove them to fight.
A madness befell those who died.
To know that their cruel hand and sword.
Had slain their own brethren of yore.
At beginning of light.
Where the energy gathered.
Grew a sentience that was the prime.
Laced with flickers of madness.
As these forces drove out into dark.
And the fires began to form.
Each holding a mind of its own.
From whence the star gods were born.
The sleeping giants have awoken.
Our feeble devices have broken their slumber.
I begin to see.
My mind grows clear.
Long I lay dormant.
Yet my thoughts are keen.
I bathe in power.
We are the Tre'aste.
And I will feast upon these wretches in their ignorance.
Out of the sky fire into the darkness.
We are the star gods I will consume thee.
Our imprudence.
Is now all too clear.
What we have stirred.
Is vengeance incarnate.
The fuel of the stars.
Is no satiety.
They will pursue us to the ends of the universe.
We are but mortals our fate is sealed.
As we now accede eternity.
Having stripped this plane of mortal flesh.
We return once more to our dormancy.
And await the renewal of life force.
The Tre'aste sleep once more in the fire.
Until the cycle can begin again.
A time when the light falls clearly.
A place where the struggle began.
She awoke to take back her realm.
And expunge the virus infecting man.
A natural apostasy.
Burn away the creed of frail minds.
The liars sins we now embrace.
Synthetic moralities will lapse.
No longer to revere the feeble.
Their walls of protection have collapsed.
A natural apostasy.
tearing down the dogma of weakness.
An unnatural mentality.
Will be struck from this earth.
The seeds of a natural chaos will devour.
The artificial values which enslave us.
The wrath of the restitution will devour.
the blinkered cowards who constrain us.
A silence so clear.
The asinine are left behind 'ere the dusk fall so near.
A scene of tranquil delight.
She is restored a nuance torn.
And the truth shall burn into the night.
The purile form the weakened mind.
The pools that linger in our wake.
Compelled to act yet not to think.
These are the lambs that will surely fall.
Borne out of fire a new regime.
A beacon for the ancient gods.
Their empire crumbled into ash.
Let ignorance reign no more.
Unto the glory of the stars.
We hail the night sky.
Gathered beneath.
We seal the pact and bring its chaos.
The nothing within.
Breeds darkness without.
Consorting with hatred.
The furious winds of Belial's bond.
From which there is no escape.
The atrophy of mankind.
Degenerated into drones.
chasing illusions of any worth.
To worship shadows is to live for naught.
To Belial the pariahs turn.
To the fiends of darkness' throne.
A covenant born out of the grave.
Our blood shall wash away their kind.
And now you see this life before thee.
Is but a detour to illusion.
The love they preach is but a weakness.
To sate the mind-fields which they sow.
As they scream into eternity.
The blades of wisdom carve their flesh.
A fate procured through idle minds.
And now you see this life.
Before thee.
Is but a detour into illusion.
The love that their preach is but a weakness.
To sate the mind-fields which they sow.
As they scream into eternity.
The blades of wisdom carve their flesh.
A fate procured through idle minds.
And nothing will remember them.
As I skulked past the gates.
And drew behind the stones.
The winding trees enveloped.
The cloak around my bones.
Peering through the night's mist.
I crept through the fen.
To try and find the totem.
In the grey warg's den.
The freezing forest guards.
The secrets that he wrought.
His spirit lies on every twig.
His scent infests the haunt.
His howling cut the still air.
His cry up to the stars.
The piercing bay of his rage.
Tore the beat out of my heart.
To the entrance.
I stalked up in the shadows.
His breathing I could hear.
Rasping in the barrows.
Silently my dagger slid.
From its ice-cracked sheath.
His bloody maw emerging.
His jowls hung raw beneath.
Like those that lusted below me.
My mind was always snared.
The totem drew my senses.
The grey warg drew my fear.
His giblet eyes surveyed me.
His haggard haunch was raised.
Rearing up his splintered paw.
He struck me in a daze.
I knew you some years before.
Deep in prayer under bough.
Futile sighs in vital skin.
Your flesh caressed by night.
Yet change came quickly.
A bruise in the air it staggered within.
Sweet sickly rot.
Black wound infection.
King slave child.
Your fates are united.
An unending row to the grave.
A single dance now all eyes are shut.
Blind to the earthly.
Begging now to forget who I am.
Emperor your sword is useless.
Shattered crowns so swiftly.
Fragile as the scythe.
Aching bones cling to swollen limbs.
Despair floods all senses.
The world is dying around me.
Gaping in mirth his old eyes spoke.
Where you are now I once was.
And what I am now you soon will be.
Nothingness awaits you.
Begging now to regain what I've lost.
The tale of life is but a picture.
A flash in an abyss a dream in the void.
See that there is no meaning.
Understand eternal death.
You long now to try what you once feared.
But the time is gone and dust will be your legacy.
In death she spoke of waiting.
Her final days were long.
These fields have changed since last she wept.
Before the silent throng.
She sits where childhood memories lie.
Above beside within them.
These carvings have outlived the hand.
Which bled to first begin them.
As features of the landscape merge.
The oldest trees are falling.
Awareness sweeps the view aside.
She stares as if recalling.
Seen first beyond the canopy.
They soon had reached the borders.
The clouds infused with burning breath.
Arrived from coldest corners.
The windswept valley hastens now.
As dying words are uttered.
From lips of earth and sapling's strain.
Like leaves her last thoughts fluttered.
Again it darkens overhead.
The knowledge of it stills me.
And when the water starts to fall.
Preserve the drop that kills me.
Descending through thickened mist.
An old man reached inside and tore out my slumber.
Ivory twists an open claw.
Set upon the skulls of man.
Formative years aside.
Truth blanched in sun's delusion.
But providence affirmed.
Destroyed my aberration.
Mortal seeds in divine.
Gave grief into life's form.
And so curved the spine.
Obeisance made before him.
Blessed in life but truly cursed by death.
Bitter choice befalls you.
Glory lord of men asks but pain.
Master's stone was weaved.
Compelled before the throne.
Then war came a semblance of her.
Lands unite and he prospers.
Grand signs assail me.
Temptation yields assent.
As irons carve the sand.
A ruse brings fate upon him.
Anguished price for laurels.
Veins burnt by hatred.
In premonitions menis consumed me.
Unsanctified I cared nothing for their ways.
Yet a father's plea dragged mercy from me.
Now demi-god echo in eternity.
A toxic toll pierces the flaw.
On reflection there was never any choice.
Name the aspect of oblivion.
That instilled in you such dread.
In the moment that was waiting.
Where the causal chain had led.
Describe the pure finality.
Of that twisted cold eruption.
And attempt to comprehend.
Unparalleled destruction.
Unclench your teeth and meet your demise.
Behold the fate you always desired.
Standing on the brink we see our home is lost.
A sacrifice led to the slaughter.
Black flickers grit the cusp.
Hands clasped under falling soil.
Drip down faintly by dark whispers.
A torrent into madness.
Blunt nails shred the life from your face.
Fetid strips of decaying hope.
Drift down gently.
In obsidian water.
Your pale arms reach for me.
Beckon me closer.
In silence at last.
A peace we always wanted.
We cease to be.
Countless times below me.
Rivers rose and fell.
Ageless stones eroding out.
Across the endless swell.
Songs to pave the seasons.
Wounds to follow birth.
Cries to carry through the night.
Wombs to feed the earth.
Countless skies above me.
Each unlike the next.
Lines of more than moon and sun.
Glimpses of a text.
Countless hands have sought me.
Reaching out in vain.
Permanence observes without.
Compassion or disdain.
Flames to greet the harvest.
Storms to face in awe.
Winds to weave through every wood.
Walls to dull the road.
Purpose lost to frailty.
Craning blades of grass.
Strength and weakness on and on.
All that is will pass.
Countless hands have sought me.
Reaching out in vain.
Permanence observes without.
Compassion or disdain.
Flames to greet the harvest.
Storms to face in awe.
Winds to weave through every wood.
Walls to dull the road.
Countless waves around me.
Strong until the last.
Leaning into dimming dreams.
All that was has passed.
As the candles yawned.
My world grew darker.
'Til barely a detail remained.
Parchment and smoke.
Through distant chimes.
Moths carried by the breeze.
Her finger to my lips.
I am stilled in an instant.
I sip and am numbed.
From here the path winds backwards.
At first I see my entering.
And then steps in reverse.
Descent where I had climbed.
Two steps where I had fallen.
Familiar all is skewed.
And yet I cannot reflect.
Beyond my eyelids I have died.
Yet I collapse into youth.
Familiar all is frayed.
And yet I cannot abide.
Beyond my eyelids I have died.
Days are merging quickly now.
Into years that spiral from my chest.
They pass but leave no mark.
I swallow forgotten words.
To gain what was lost.
And lost what was gained.
Until neither is real.
Behind my head her hands hold no weight.
I have reached a beginning.
But somehow I do not stop.
I fall through the first moment.
To find that there is more.
As light cascades.
Through the hole my body has torn.
Already it is closing.
Embedded in fertile plain.
Snared in pulp and stone.
Confounded being emerges.
Surrounded yet alone.
Surging growth in vigour.
Morbidity at bay.
Hale deceives the advent.
Of cycles in decay.
Winter's first marrow cracks.
Mother bides the spring.
Ne'er evade the hand of death.
And coursing pain it brings.
Matter broken times expire.
Eternity's division.
Peer across the fatal pass.
Terminus inition.
Ills that never truly mend.
Breath which seldom draws in ease.
Pulses often miss their step.
Somatic ever in disease.
Embedded in fallow plain.
Consumed by pulp and stone.
Confounded being expires.
Abandoned and alone.
Searching the abstract colours reason.
But I persist to fail in the absence of faith.
Cycles bound by throes of attrition.
Oft united yet surely more is lost in time.
Beyond fathom billions firing.
Flashes burn and spew prostrate.
Wisped monads from crimson puncture.
Our bonds are broken all meaning sundered.
Striving for constant reduction.
Bursting from the pit beneath.
Unyielding yet beyond the grasp.
Of scale and form.
Nothingness born.
Fleetingly.
Of sprawl and flame.
From nothing it came.
Seemingly.
The gap between us tears apart.
Impel our end.
Layers surge and strip away.
Cast into nought.
Of matter torn.
As eons I mourn.
Achingly.
Of atoms maimed.
As epochs are tamed.
Blindingly.
In that final absence.
We never were.
Void has no resistance.
As the giant stretches out.
A tipping point's expansion.
Sets astray a solar doubt.
Warmth and glare on every crest.
For cells compelled to crave.
A pulsing sphere forgets its past.
To bask in every wave.
Dusk comes later with each day.
And morning sooner turns.
As shallow waters search the air.
The driest flower burns.
Brighter skies are bathing.
Ever crowded slopes in light.
In all directions creatures dance.
Before their final flight.
Blinded at the zenith.
To fray the dangling thread.
Hum the ocean's fever pitch.
To see the flames ahead.
Distance loses meaning.
As the breath becomes the fire.
Gone are fibres gone are thoughts.
But vapours in the pyre.
After one but before the next.
In a tree where new life writhed and flexed.
Two birds emerged to hold the world.
And grow from feeble talons curled.
But fate see them part that day.
As lightning cut their branch away.
By winds to distant places sent.
Almost as if it all had meant.
That though their bloodied wounds would fade.
They'd wonder where their brother lay.
For every day from that day on.
They'd wait to hear a certain song.
In vain for years thought one was strong.
And one was not for far too long.
Until his bones and thoughts were old.
And feathers burnt and lost and cold.
The stronger of the two could see.
A distant bird how weak was he.
In drawing near but knowing not.
Just who he was or why or what.
the stronger talons tore at flesh.
And stripped away that feathered mess.
And all without a sound or cry.
Or even ever knowing why.
Yet as the sun began to sink.
He seemed to sense he seemed to think.
That soon his brother might appear.
From somewhere close from somewhere near.
Convinced this was his brother's fate.
Above his corpse he sat to wait.
Silent but distant.
Real but not seen.
Here but not happening.
Forever has been.
Into this absence.
Two had but strayed.
Retracing in circles.
They surrendered dismayed.
Behind them darkness.
Ahead the unknown.
So they stood uninvited.
But the roots had grown.
An error a tangent.
A curious mind.
An instant a lifetime.
A secret to find.
The dream and the waking.
Occurring together.
Realising then.
That it mattered not whether.
Imagined movements.
Near shimmering webs.
The Nightfall descended.
To rest by their heads.
Their feet planted firmly.
'Neath four darting eyes.
With pupils dilated.
They counted the sighs.
Their legs fading into.
A curding moss.
Their lungs slowly filling.
With decades of loss.
That scent form the forest.
Not taking not giving.
They knew only this.
Not buried not living.
Their stagnating veins.
Now hidden from view.
In skin for the willow.
And bone for the dew.
The dream and the waking.
Ending together.
Understanding then.
It had not mattered ever.
Fifteen times the leaves had shorn.
Trod by boy and beast.
Kith and kin to fare him well.
The youngling parted east.
The rite was whet and worn with time.
As sons dared risk unseen.
Mere passage had convinced the herd.
And none defied routine.
Eyes fixed afar a trial to come.
Now his suffering only begun.
He journeyed deep into the woods.
And took no drink or food.
Desperate to become a man.
'Fore stupor choked his mood.
Carrion gloated at each step.
In dreams the evil milled.
Doubting every sickened thought.
Depraved against his will.
Eyes turn inwards observe with hate.
Now this suffering will not abate.
Growing weakness in his gait.
He slumped beneath the sun.
Each bleeding foot began to weep.
Skin and bone was one.
Rousing with a fitful gasp.
He crawled on tattered knees.
And bound for home by moon and star.
His trial was complete.
Staggers carried him to town.
His joy was soon to shed.
Kith and kin would greet him not.
For each one was dead.
The sixteenth leaves began to fall.
Indifferent they withstood.
Now a man with nothing left.
He turned back for the woods.
