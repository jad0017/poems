twelve days of rain press my sigh.
i breed in fever.
but somehow don't die.
rain without end.
i eat the breath.
your flesh brings life.
i'm going to see.
i will never be clean again.
i fell asleep at the gate.
tonight i feel that demon's hand.
your blood that drains my head.
i eat the breath.
your flesh brings me life.
i will never be clean again.
it's like burning myself real.
a fire to you.
commending will what happen.
like drowning away in the sea.
flowing with the rain.
i wish to see heaven.
you fed me life through vein.
life through rain.
a night to see.
you fed me life.
death's who you want.
long yet hunted.
ephemeral you're on the breeze.
you rest in grey.
eternally sleep.
erase the day.
i couldn't see her.
through all the rain.
and her sigh.
holding our breath to the end.
we end up far away.
out on the breeze.
take me past the horizon.
we're running out of time.
anywhere is nowhere.
everywhere is fear.
and you just.
all the walls of my gloomy house.
it's like awaiting.
the end of the world.
here in this days.
the end of the world.
there is no answer.
to all that is crying.
when all those die.
to carry on forever.
all painted cold.
sightless i saw a sign.
somewhere outside.
by a depth inside.
i am blinded.
i lay back.
my spirit is closing in.
gave to it losing tomorrow.
it's all painted cold.
i'm not here today.
i'm not here at all.
it's all painted clear.
just like the day.
and when the night closed your eyes.
i read upon your lips.
this is not today.
not even tomorrow.
blue gallery.
infinite submission.
last night before us.
i close tight your hold.
and you come to me.
when all is gone.
you want me to fall back.
the will is all dead.
so let me come in as one.
so let me come in as one.
it's darkest for to see.
i see it all.
the light will only stall.
and you come to me.
when all is gone.
i want me to fall back.
you will die now.
the will is all dead grey dawn.
i painted with rain the sight of the daybreak.
as being in need of a momentary remake.
the life i am leading is the way of depravity.
a threat th my already poisoned sanity.
grey dawn everlasting.
hope is utopia for all that i know.
when counting the seconds time moves so slow.
i can't feel any will to be part of this fight.
a cure is however to put thrust in the night.
i learn from this life to hide from humanity.
and night has told me how to kill my anxiety.
the ghost of my smile dances in the pale.
and i know all my efforts most likely will fail.
october insight the tales untold are true.
spirits of water circle above you.
as you trespass the side of the fall.
drawn into darkness.
drawn by the call.
breathe in the night.
an october insight.
as you can see grey is not white.
the land of the bleak has never been black.
once we are here we can never get back.
rain without end.
this is a dead run.
desperately lacking the light of a sun.
all it can be.
a dead world revealed.
only to those who can never be free.
lost in the halflight.
no colours appear.
they're only a story not even near.
what is really the seemingly eternal fight.
to dwell within this lesser kind of night.
sweetness dies.
these words i scream out loud.
they vanish in the wind.
and winters weight upon us.
has buried the life i knew.
life as on the walls.
has turned into the past.
you know that i will wander.
through wind and rain to ease my pain.
i've seen my soul fall down.
sinking right into the past.
erasing all the signs of hope.
sweetness dies.
can never last.
the scattered taste of death.
gets closer to my mouth.
and the smell of blood.
lies thicker in the air.
than what it used to be.
when you were still around.
it's time for me to go.
it's time to leave it's all i know.
heart of the dead.
i have waited with patience for this moment to come.
a promise i expected not to be alone.
when the wind of the dark comes enclosing us in.
the whisper gets closer and i fake this grin.
a stranger in town with a bloodshot eye.
sucked out my disease when i was said to die.
i won't spend t he rest of my death underground.
he laughed as i died i am no longer bound.
my heart is not red.
this sea i've bled.
i have sold my fucking soul to the dead.
their hunger is fed.
the beast in my head.
heart of the dead.
heart of the dead.
i left in the darkest hour.
i'm tired of breathing rain.
still the night devours.
each and every inch of pain.
no longer dressed in soil.
a guardian of the black and the cold.
spirits of liars leading my way.
no longer inferno.
on earth i will stay.
floating uncontrolled riot.
in my soul that is.
devastating fire.
please burn the way through this.
all systems collapse in my inner sanctum.
while i'm still alive.
then why postpone the thing that i hope for.
the craving for an instant death.
i'm crawling out of the filth that i live in.
only to see the sun.
sink below a dead horizon.
this one and only time.
deep down the waters.
a man who's made of guilt.
is floating out in the silence.
the dead's laughter has built.
and wherever i came from.
i can't remember now.
'cause deep down the waters.
i'm floating out to drown.
lost in the dark and then gone.
there's a white room in my dreams.
a shot in the head.
a head full of lead.
that's the only way to survive.
the only way to go ahead.
there's a red room in the house.
a room full of stains.
where nothing remains.
except for a mistreated soul.
that is lost in the dark and then gone.
i am screaming but no one can hear me.
then it's silent and silent is all.
it can be 'cause this is a clean room.
except for the stains on the wall.
into deep sleep.
dim the lights and sleep.
night has brought me here.
you're falling far too deep.
you're awake when i am near.
my soul has lost this fight.
i'm no longer on my own.
old companions ride tonight.
cold pale dawn.
defining the spirit alive at last.
the sign of the fall.
the burden upon me.
the very last call.
we're passing time my dear.
the air is thick with all my fears.
you know i wish you all the best.
i'll put you here so you can rest.
dear sun.
the custodian of science.
bathing in your private fears.
held back by the need of control.
you are conducting yourself by the proper manners.
never let down by the cameras eye.
the custodian of your science sets the stage.
all the bravery are now lost for the fragile minds.
i am facing a new day with caution.
i'm paralyzed by the lack of surveillance.
i am crawling in the shadows i'm hiding.
hiding behind the crumbling walls.
becoming the trigger of your own tears.
you are the weakest of links in this chain reaction.
so tell me now.
what are your deepest fears.
so tell me now.
why can't you let go.
a commotion in this mind stifles a headless kind.
it is constant darkness in this legacy of shadows.
a marriage to suspiciousness awake by senses.
the faceless watcher stalks in the corner of your eyes.
so you run from the secrets that is haunting you now.
the custodian of your science are in control.
so you run from the secrets that is haunting you now.
the custodian of your science are in control.
so tell me now.
what are your deepest fears.
so tell me now.
why can't you just let go.
deplorable request.
shut it all down.
the facts and the memories.
i have been running around inside.
on this borrowed time.
the medical poison.
it stabilizes and drags me back.
though it is against my will.
locked inside this suite of flesh and blood.
stranded on clean sheets forever.
with the parasites in my veins.
i can hear your cries.
i can feel your breath to the end.
you have been visiting me for so long now.
erase the map of the past.
i am fighting with my heart as an enemy.
falling through a black hole for eternity.
caught in an endless sleep with this hollow dreams.
capture the light and pour it over me.
a benefactor forbidden to all humanity.
bring me a trail and please let me feel pain.
turn to the next page.
ease your depression.
you will find it better when i'm gone this will lead you insane.
i can hear your cries.
i can feel your breath to the end.
you have been visiting me for so long now.
a nighttime project.
blackness devours.
i awake by cold shivers.
apprehend voices but not the ones in my head.
i try to ignore and turn back.
i shut down gain sanity.
forcing my breathing to become slower.
forcing my pulse to beat lower.
suffocating scream behind walls.
pleading the past to let go.
i find myself awake again i am starring at the sealing.
is this all inside.
are the suffering screams meant for me to silence.
fumbling for the light in despair.
i'm searching with my eyes for no reason.
i'm stumbling in the darkness i fall to the floor.
back on my feet again.
wrapped up in my indecision.
the darkness lingers upon me.
blackness devours fast.
it drives me further across the floor.
then a sudden scream shuts the door behind.
a monolith of a roar summoning its daemons.
turning around for an answer.
is this all inside of me.
no way to avoid this collapse.
i dare not stay so i reach for the switch.
then a sudden scream shuts the door behind.
summoning of daemons.
the dividing line.
i the stalker.
the dagger behind your back.
days are turning darker.
we follow you on every path.
fear are growing in the eyes of the underdog.
for each day we increase the obstacles.
pushing you down again and again.
to determinate the limits.
the mind have become so twisted.
i am saving myself by hurting the others.
the anxiety and the sympathy.
are scanning my spiteful conscience.
i the leader.
scars been given.
hearts collapse.
impossible to repair.
i dare to tread the dividing line.
now they all turned against me.
i received the eyes of the underdog.
i carry the pain with pride.
i am leaving.
i'm heading for end.
you the stalker.
the dagger behind my back.
days are turning darker.
you will follow me on every path.
fragile small steps closer to the mirror.
the shame is in the deep.
slipping through a vast form feeling fragile.
with hollow heart a thin shell a reflecting art.
still searching for hope.
year apart the shallow grave still to deep.
like an avalanche of pain.
overwhelming shapeless and bleak.
the creator is waiting as i seek.
dying inside.
try to hide away from psychic lies.
they pull me under.
constant waiting for my relief.
will i ever see the rising sun.
locked gate until it will be better.
appreciation of the loss.
mind conspiracy of a future healing.
the conclusion is safe in the core.
with a hollow heart just a thin shell my reflecting art.
still searching for hope.
i bleed myself to comprehend.
a thousand hours in your hands.
plead for answers not the end.
this final destination is not a threat.
no more scorned ghost in corner.
reflecting a strong side of me.
flame is lost.
i wish for once of difference.
lack of self-confidence.
this scene grew fast.
still look for light.
everyone reliefs hate.
i'm forced to walk among this creatures.
the well of strength vaporized to dust.
a new dawn comes sweeping in.
delivers a deep breath.
eyes faint open body feels decrepit.
i'm taking the same way as the days before.
ready to take some of the bruises ready to be out to scorn.
will they ever stop.
of wounds to come.
cast aside my will.
decomposing soul abandoned and cold.
every step is a foot in the grave.
admitting the pain is too profound for the brave.
i release you from my arms again.
no this is not my burden.
lifeless always.
your words will remain.
but your image a crooked frame.
with a mind like seasons there's no chance for reason.
the withering brings promise of dichotomy.
reflections of what i've done our requiem.
the horizon is a reminder of wounds to come.
the smoke will lead you home.
if i could only burn.
the words i've yet to learn.
i saw the light in the sky.
we weren't always so blind to the lies devouring life.
when the last star falls who's to blame.
for the eternal night of wishes reclaimed.
the dawn of the new day same faces new pain.
to carry on would be insane.
i release you from my arms again.
no this is not my burden.
close your eyes and breath.
time to leave this will be the end.
where do i begin.
this was a mistake i have nothing to say.
your pain is well deserved.
i've lived and loved and all i've learned.
we can we can can only promise to burn.
marvel at the bridges flame wonder why they never came.
end of all.
they consider the body a temple.
tear down the walls.
the horizon is a reminder of wounds to come.
our constellation.
it was misery that aligned our stars.
a glimpse of sorrow soon unbound our scars.
unraveling skies so carry on.
the answer it hides is not what you seek.
kissing the mouth of crues words.
a language of truth no one will speak.
the rain fell so shall i.
the past speaks your name.
i sever the silver line for the last time.
make no mistake your desperation it still lingers.
all that you take love's expiration.
it's drawing nearer.
make no mistake your desperation found it's way to your finger.
all that you take love's expiration.
follow me.
to the edge of the earth.
i hope you find all that you search.
i'll just wait for our stars to align.
we've always strayed towards tunnels that hold no light.
wretched day lies are horrid.
beauty of truth i am slain.
emptiness fulfilled.
i watched you pass most darkened cloud.
the calm before you was i.
like a curse i will lift you.
off your feet swept by every verse escaping lips of deceit.
there is no other way to clear these skies of grey.
oh i don't know which way i should go.
i've filled a sea of tears careless wonder a farewell to fears.
there is no other way to clear these skies of grey.
in the night.
these shadows know me well.
no answer to these calls of distress.
when only time can tell.
i'm no stranger to emptiness.
and all that ever mattered shattered.
out of hand out of time.
out of reach out of mind.
all that shined in the night once gathered.
in the depths of sleepness dark enlighten my path.
apathy caught in silence.
take away thy suffering.
from the daemons trapped inside.
can't see these creatures.
born out of obscenity.
how to see the finders.
how to hide from the signal lights.
look for warnings look for signs.
watch out for the hollow minds.
emotions are burned away.
step into this lake of fire.
try to reach a higher ground.
before being swallowed alive.
take shelter in the storm.
soon it will reach its eye.
on a journey further.
to find who survives.
the day i dissolved.
eternally incomplete.
perpetual fracture a fraction.
we dwell until we are too deep.
we wander still too far too reach.
our reality shatters before our eyes drown us in broken glass.
truth is the only lie.
life's affliction time will not rewind.
you turned away you let me breath.
until you hang me from your heartstrings.
we dwell until we are too deep.
you were the promise but not mine to keep.
time does not exist we are slaves to distance.
there is no purpose for any of this.
our reality shatters before our eyes.
there is no purpose to any for us to exist.
hang me from your heartstrings.
nothing all i've become.
with zero i am one.
there is no resolve.
take me back to the day i dissolved.
time will not rewind truth the only lie.
as sleep carries you away from me all fears sincerity condemned to dreams.
our reality shatters before our eyes drown us in broken glass.
time does not exist we are slaves to distance.
there is no purpose for any of this.
watching the drowners.
waves come crushing.
ten feet tall and roaring.
destroyer oppressor the will is ancient.
beyond knowledge and sworn to disaster.
ten feet tall and rising.
no resistance left.
the grip of old has come.
hereby we are the watchers.
they are drowners for their faith is futile.
the tide is raging.
against all of man's work.
punisher liberator being all at once.
trespassers in the sacred waters.
sickening slow death.
silver dawn upon us.
ashen sky a drowners heart in each of our hands.
in hopeless pursuit.
all eternal laments my stigma.
i have failed you.
what can summon forgiveness now.
when songs of endless grief go unheard.
deafen the ears muting the mouth.
no words will ever bring you back now.
i yet possessed i strive i'm haunted by dreams.
this void has embodied me.
losing the faith.
that should never have been placed.
in hopeless pursuit.
of the crippled artist's winter heart.
most wretched mind painted me a picture.
now what i am to do with the visions you've left behind.
i don't feel alive.
from the dark that i've held inside.
will you wait can you see.
shadows bleeding out from me.
even when all else is whole.
you'll still be alone.
well i'm leaving with your heart still beating.
it grows cold.
adoring ashes.
i brought fire to the gates of heaven.
enraptured by the coldes of hearts.
tales of it's worship.
the words that echoed in vain.
i am the empty.
i whispered goodbye.
my voice carried by the wind.
finds it's way to you will you listen.
my words burn with the sun.
will they be heard or will it be shunned.
all life and dreams lost over night.
the moons rose a flood too high this time.
losing hope in the tragic tide.
the words that echoed in vain.
i am empty i whispered goodbye.
to remain non-existent.
revel in irrelevance.
your bitter reflection your mind is straying.
the soul misdirected your departure betraying.
your world is falling down i've come to reclaim my crown.
your eyes open today.
i will be there i cannot stay.
voice of reason heed the call.
ash like snow prayers fall.
saw you there, in a field out that way.
sun was setting perfectly, adorned a mask.
visage outshining the day.
white dress; dancing, ablaze in your spotlight.
cicadas from a halo, gentle coercion.
forcing day into night.
forcing day into a night.
insect eclipse; frail wings that claim the heavens.
swarm eating bliss; a screeching symphony, came and went.
existence now a silhouette.
white dress; dancing, ablaze in your spotlight.
cicadas from a halo, gentle coercion.
forcing day into night.
lingering doubt of the end; no longer stands.
destruction; threads woven by a single hand.
we stitch our necks to the branch.
all thing undone, feet wave like pendulum.
six legs; crawling back.
to play me a song.
there is a light somewhere across the sea.
in brilliant stride glimmering star it seems.
speaking in a radiant pulse.
the wondrous path in cryptic gleam.
glimmering star it seems.
this is the code.
oh this i know.
illuminate to reveal a meaning somehow.
this fleeting sense of purpose.
it cascades.
dusting off the ash to become no longer afraid.
caught in trance.
purity with vantablack.
intertwined they dance.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
the watchful siren of perilous seas.
she laughs and sinks with me.
these stones and rope bound to my limbs.
like words never said again.
can we speak through waves of sight and sound,
or are we frail like a god uncrowned?
oh sleepless sun.
this is not our time.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
still caught in trance.
purity with vantablack.
intertwined they dance.
this is the code.
oh this i know.
illuminate to reveal a meaning somehow.
an ensemble.
our rapture.
perfect incandescence.
oh sleepless sun.
no need to wonder why.
the blood flows in burning tides.
through the gutter that is your veins.
it keeps you awake, keeps you aflame.
the moment of respite, brought the splendor of hate.
premonition savored like the stranger's embrace.
sacred is nothing, give it all up.
the soul, even the body.
free-will destroyed.
fill the omnipresent void.
sacred is nothing, give it all up.
the soul, even the body.
free-will destroyed.
fall into insouciance.
an eathquake passes without attention.
sewers of red now turning grey.
nowhere is my shelter and home.
no need to worrie now.
you just have to let go.
release the soul, even the body.
you have to let go.
it keeps you awake, keeps you aflame.
plagues crafted, from gold.
silver, our light when darkness unfolds.
at the mercy of mournfull eyes.
awating the call.
bittersweet, effugy.
recited by us all.
a sanctuary of promises.
now left behind, abandon me.
the gift of warmth.
the sun surrounds.
to burn the memory.
a question ignite.
triggers a massive scale.
lifting every stone.
leaving nothing untouched.
feelings arouse to overwhelm.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
thoughts come close to deluge.
excess the presence for the fallen.
but still there are mountains unclimbed.
finding more pain to absorb.
to endure in hope, in hop for a meaning.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
decay in the dark unforgiving.
in these surroundings we are enslaved.
a question ignite.
triggers a massive scale.
lifting every stones.
envy for the ones that are living.
sympathy for the lost, for the lost and blackened.
reaching through, reaching through the dark.
searching the stars on the darkening skies.
clouds thickens to total black.
the sky prepair for battle.
i share my tears for my fallen dreams.
that have lost their shape in shame.
a leash on my heart restraining me.
from reaching my dreams from within.
fading into the darkness.
searching to fill the void inside.
lying trembling on the floor.
demons crying out of the darkness below.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
a calm form of turmoil.
where do the demons live?
why do you fear the night.
am i the reason why you run and hide?
the darkness that lives in me.
can't leave, i will never be free.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
chained to the bottom, nursed by the cold.
silence in dispute with hungry rage.
a calm form of turmoil.
where do the demons live?
unsought, a slumber for weary eyes.
bring forth all reflections, shrouding the aimless.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
embracing the cold,smiles lost in life's rapturous fold.
surrender at the waking hour.
hearts breaking with the dawn.
defeat, nostalgia beckoning.
to fall just for the stars.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
a mesmerizing spectacle.
the sun and i, are we no the same at all?
the burning wheel, the archetype.
of constant rise.
of constant fall.
unsought, a slumber for weary eyes.
bring forth all reflection, shrouding the aimless mind.
here i am, forgetting to breath.
once more caught in this reverie.
where i simply ceased to be.
forgetting to breath.
an ode to those.
drowning in a sea of dreams.
the few that know.
the feeling.
something alway missing.
sheer pressure of existing.
when the emptiness comes.
it's hard to be whole.
you have been replaced, although.
it's bitterness that linger; in the place you once called home.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
the sight that captivates; amiss.
stealing a breath.
the eyes that resuscitate.
in the bloom of death.
no, you are never alone.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
lost in the garden.
where only darkness seems to grow.
you are not alone.
waiting for the feathers to fall.
wrag your feet, hang your head, walk along the walls.
in this labyrinth of thorns.
what is left? what is right?
where memories are born; just to lose their light.
the hand that led you here is not to blame.
the grip, the warmth, the smile, the fear.
something always missing.
the iron in the name.
it was always hidden, can't you see?
when i disappear, promise that you'll find me.
where the sky and ocean meet.
