i felt something was wrong.
a strange thought in my head am i really awake.
the undead keep dreaming.
i found myself again in bed confused by what occurred.
and everything as usual just seemed to be in place.
but when i questioned what i felt in front the mirror black.
the comfort of the morning light was stolen from my heart.
in agony i tried to leave this dream and just awake.
but on and on i found myself returning in my bed.
i lost the count of times i tried and failed to reach the day.
and even now i am not sure if i am here awake.
the undead keep dreaming.

both its end can leadboth can deceive.
no traps can seizethe eldest cosmonaut.
as time stands stillincapable to breathe.
once in clay i allowed the decades.
to become a stone wall around me.
but at least i became the wall of decades.
can you feel the wrinkles on my hand.
they are yoursthey are lines i once.
drew upon the sand.
i have a boat unseen a labyrinthine sphere.
the gnosis of the eldest cosmonaut.
and maybe you will see.
that i am what your mind can neverseal.
travelling the luminiferous waters of space.
through the stellar isthmus.
it can lead it can decieve.
no traps can seize meno toombs can seal me.
i have a boat unseen a labyrinthine sphere.
the gnosis of the eldest cosmonaut.
and maybe you will see.
that i am what your mind can neverseal.
marble smiling face.
black leather gloves.
on soft thin hands.
red celtic knives.
sharp as your touch.
hunting eagle proudly land.
on this island that's my heart.
twin mirrors blue.
cold lakes consealing fire.
red coral hair.
a dazzling ruby dome.
hunting eagle proudly land.
on this island that's my heart.
elegance combined with grace.
dressed your marble smiling face.
underworld.
tranquilityhow necessaryhow boring it can be.
the liquid void has no ears.
to receive the consolation of the surface.
maybe it's better that way.
what doesn't touch doesn't hurt.
the innocence of a swan.
gliding on a desolate lake.
can't be sensed.
and therefore can't bring jealousy.
entire worlds full of wonder are banished.
to rest only in few visionary minds.
haunting them with their glowing beauty.
fortunatelythere are always.
those with the forked tongue.
to bring the borders closer.
but there are also tribes of inferior beings.
beings so proudly inferior.
necessary to give worth to the higher.
but not without cost.
they liberate ordeals.
their negative thought is the fungus.
the grim vestment of the relic.
the eroding frankincence of marasmous.
can become untolerable.
their region is warm like a blanket.
but narrow as a coffin.
an underworld.
fortunately there are always.
those with the forked tongue.
that bring the borders closer.
temple of the lost race.
preserved from the ancient years.
when earth was just a newborn star.
the proof of a distant truth.
arrogantly stands mocking the wind.
guarding mysteries that man has not unchained.
an emblem of power has remained  a fallen temple.
faded pictures all over the walls.
projecting a horrid state of sanity.
figures that don't belong to a human race.
symbols and maps.
architectural miracles carrying the history of a race.
that now seems lost.
fears born from the past.
temple of the lost race.
deep inside the heart of the pole.
an old ruler of the stars.
buried in a chest from glass.
the answers about our path.
eternal life can't rest asleep.
it lurks beneath as force of will.
ancient are the rules set on this world.
an emblem of power will remaine  a fallen temple.
fears born from the past.
temple of the lost race.
deep inside the heart of the pole.
an old ruler of the stars.
the crypt.
in a dream i saw a man.
a face not strange to me.
he stared at me while i was asleep and wispered in my ear.
he led me through the corridors of my anscestral home.
he stoped one step before one wall and then i fainted.
in the eldest wall of my home i found the entrance of a crypt.
the view i saw was so obscure.
alien remnants pentagrams and candless of the floor.
the crypt was made as a passage to the gates of reality.
and just when i realised the truth i was in a different shape.
i hear thousants of sounds.
like bestial laughsdeafening flutes and daemonic choirs.
possibilities fall under control unfolding new dimensions.
setting of the two suns.
in a world of endless light into the boundless space.
two suns the only gods two burning holes in the sky.
without a warning the two suns slowly faded.
abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold.
down on their kneesthey have total consience.
as night drains their spiritthe inner light of logic.
leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet.
stumbling to others that now are animalscrying light.
setting of the two suns.
then a light came from the horizon.
devouring the land.
it wasn't sun.
it took a minute for a flame to become a fire.
the great cities will all become ashes.
drifting with the wind.
erebus.
waiting the drawing of the underworld.
none to share your fears.
the shadow of charon falls.
upon the stone of hopes.
the body is paralizing.
the air is too thick to enter.
a cataclysm is spawend into the regions of the soul.
the cry of the first time.
when you were free from the womb.
is the same but now you are entering the night.
most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
life seems pointless with an end.
they wonder if existence remains after death.
or erebus is the final state.
you knew from the begging.
that the end will come in time.
yet so many things you left undone.
so many more unknown.
in a life that is but a dream.
into a gods dream.
most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
life seems pointless with an end.
existence is a choice that remains after death.
erebus is my mental state.
underworld.
our patience has been dried away.
since a long time.
and the thirstthe need to unfold desire.
transforming it into a touchable object.
how bitter was the taste of emptyness.
in our illformed mouths.
but it was natural as our ideas.
was based on wishes younger.
weed as fruits at first.
your fathers knew.
these worlds by heart.
even those that never ever crossed.
the eerie side.
we came to see the upper world.
where colours dance and the air moves bright.
we came to see.
as a cat with her claws extended.
orchestrates a merciless grasp.
weapons move damn swiftly.
in an attacking stance.
ready to cut through.
and open doors grimson.
your fathers knew.
these worlds by heart.
even those that never ever crossed.
the eerie side.
let me heal your wounds with mine.
now that you have deceived the night.
rest assured that none of us.
will ever lose the way to you.
these stains are also traces.
and they clean conscience.
as it is their duty to do so.
the order was strict.
conquer or be conquered.
our patience has been dried away.
since a long time.
and the thirstthe need to unfold desire.
transforming it into a touchable object.
hold no more your horses.
let them run like lava.
melting stone and granite.
in hollow caves.
raging victory acts as shepherd.
leading the way.
