It's been six years \\
\h and I've just begun to see. \\
You no longer haunt me while awake \\
\h but you still reflect in my dreams. \\
\\
You always dance by the lakeside; \\
\h smiling, \\
\h\h while you're hair rides the breeze. \\
\\
You always seem so happy---so relaxed. \\
\\
And then I remember \\
\h that you would never smile. \\
\\
Not like that. \\
Not for me. \\
\\
You only smiled \\
\h for those crude cuts on your wrists. \\
\h for all those failures. \\
\\
And when I remember\ldots{} \\
\h your body covered in blood\ldots{} \\
\\
Your eyes were still wet when I found you. \\
\\
And when I remember\ldots{} \\
\h when you said that you loved me\ldots{} \\
\h and when I said that I could not love you\ldots{} \\
\\
That distorted image of you \\
\h dancing in sun \\
\h\h changes form. \\
\\
The lake becomes a carmine sea \\
\h and your face no longer resembles my friend. \\
