% Where have you gone,

% We're too young

% You said that you loved me

%
% Crude cuts on your wrists.
%
% I always watched you when you cried;
% waiting, hoping, for your eyes to dry
% and never wet again.
%
% When that once-red fog had lifted...
% the stark accusation of my dearest friend...

You always dance by the lakeside; \\
\h smiling, \\
\h\h while you're hair rides the breeze. \\
\\
You always seem so happy---so relaxed. \\
\\
And then I remember \\
\h that you would never smile. \\
\\
Not like that. \\
Not for me. \\
\\
You only smiled \\
\h for those crude cuts on your wrists. \\
\h for all those failures. \\
\\
And when I remember\ldots{} \\
\h your body covered in blood\ldots{} \\
\\
Your eyes were still wet when I found you. \\
\\
And when I remember\ldots{} \\
\h when you said that you loved me\ldots{} \\
\h and when I said that I could not love you\ldots{} \\
\\
That distorted image of you \\
\h dancing in the sun \\
\h\h changes form. \\
\\
The lake becomes a carmine sea \\
\h and your face no longer resembles my friend. \\
\\
Your body contorts \\
\h and you sprint towards mine. \\
\\
I don't know where you got the knife\ldots{} \\
%\h I never knew\ldots{} \\
\h but my heart still stops. \\
% ^ try to remove the never knew part? leave it hanging?
% Maybe just "I don't know where you go the knife..."
\\
It's been six years \\
\h and it's still my fault. \\
