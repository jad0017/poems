\\
One night \\
\hh{}I made \\
\hh{}myself \\
\hh{}small. \\
\\% I feel the demons in my head at my side
Through the cracks I fell \\
from my bed \\
to the hall. \\
\\
Where the clock and I \\
would tick \\
as one. \\
\\
While \\
the shadows shifted \\
like wandering eyes \\
around my chamber. \\
\\
They. \\
\hh{}Wont. \\
\hh\hh{}Stay. \\
\hh\hh\hh{}Shut. \\

\textbf{II} \\
\\
On that night \\
\hh{}I fought \\
\hh{}my \\
\hh{}mind. \\
\\
I felt \\
the demons \\
at my side. \\
\\
From my head \\
spilled the words \\
that entomb me now. \\
\\
Among these walls, \\
where fragments live, \\
like a curse cosigned \\
to a clausless debt. \\
\\
They. \\
\hh{}Speak. \\
\hh{}\hh{}To. \\
\hh{}\hh{}\hh{}Me. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\textbf{III} \\
\\
On that night \\
\hh{}I gave up\\
\hh{}my heavens. \\
\\
To \\
walk along \\
a barren \\
landscape \\
featured only \\
with sand. \\
\\
In silence \\
along my path \\
singing \\
oblivion. \\
\\
As I let \\
my flesh strip away\\
in the coarse wind. \\
\\
It. \\
\hh{}Chaffes. \\
\hh{}\hh{}My. \\
\hh{}\hh{}\hh{}Soul. \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\textbf{IV} \\
\\
On that night \\
\hh{}I let them\\
\hh{}in. \\
\\
While \\
I scraped the ground \\
to saciate \\
my thirst. \\
\\
They called through the night. \\
\\
That chaos \\
deceiving my hopless \\
endeavor to a gleam. \\
catharsis. \\
\\
To slaughter \\
the absence \\
that drained me. \\
\\
The. \\
\hh{}Search. \\
\hh{}\hh{}Is. \\
\hh{}\hh{}\hh{}Dry. \\
\end{tabular} \\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\\
\textbf{V} \\
\\
On that night \\
\hh{}I driped \\
\hh{}with sin. \\
\\
Ghastly dreams \\
were storming in. \\
\\
On that night \\
\hh{}I made \\
\hh{}myself \\
\hh{}small. \\
\\
No sign of hope; \\
No heaven to hear \\
me then \\
when all I needed \\
was a friend. \\
