Ignominious if it were not December;
Ridiculous if it were not winter;
This vibrant atrocity;
This vortex of color and unicorns puke;

These cheap nits in red and black
Poorly adorned by rainbows and cats;

These loose cardigans green, grisled, and gold
Depicting a fat man commanding
Enslaved animals to walk in the snow
While he laughs a sadistic
Ho Ho Ho

These moronic prints on synthetic wool,
Of Kanye being Kanye, that everyone bought
because, hey, pop culture is cool;

And here I am, obliged, ignominious and ridiculous,
In this sweater, by Christmas tradition.
Bah Hum Bug
