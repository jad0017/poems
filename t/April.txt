Sometimes life gives you things
like lemons.
Sometimes life does not give you things
like easy.
Sometimes stress runs deep
like the ocean.
Sometimes stress does not run deep
like a kiddie pool.
Sometimes things are good
like deep fried bacon.
Sometimes things are not good
like deep fried diabetes.
But you know what is always the same?
That this poem is lame
and that you're a complex intelligent being
that can reason through all the badness
to find things that be good.
Also, you have pretty hair.
