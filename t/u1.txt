Whisper beyond your defiance.
Interweave. entangle that weeping
Horizon in which you see
The cold morphine drip; embodied and waterless.
Everywhere is unburdened,
But no calm fields call it home.
That bow, you draw back
In revulsion into painless,
Slumbering, tombs.
You rend that which guides your eyes to sleep.
You are haunted, somehow, consumed by hours
that crack and smoulder each September.
And everything. Every. Last. Piece of debris.
Will not let you go.
Will not let you tear the night's veins
Left behind by the bounded ghosts of mornings
That hiss by faster than the Earth
Dsperately setting into eternity.
