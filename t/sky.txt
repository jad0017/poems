I have seen her reflection
in my dreams.
She is faceless
and motionless
trapped beneath the waves.
From the depths with horror
an inhuman choir called out.
From the ashes
at my feet
I found
the troubled;
the tormentor;
the shell;
the essence
in endless
melancholy.
Therein lies the sorrow.
Therein lies the gloom.
Therein lies the arcana.
Therein lies her tomb.
Bitter.
Denied.
Reality.
Contempt.
Of.
Humanity.
She is locked
in the chasm.
She is abandoned and infinite;
like chaos and matter.
Struggling Squandered
Trapped Inhumane
watching
the living
crumble
and fade away.
I have seen her reflection
in my dreams.
She is faceless
and motionless
and she wants to scream.
You killed me,
is what
that inhuman voice
said.
It's all your fault.
For you I had to die.
You weren't there.
You never held me
when I cried.
It's all your fault.
For you I had to die.
You weren't there.
You only held me
when I had died.
Harbinger of Sadness.
Therein lies the knowledge.
Therein lies the hope.
Therein lies the piety.
Not some god
nor other foe.
Just a sullen face
lost to the undertow.
I have seen her reflection
in my dreams.
She is faceless
and motionless.
Her silhouette is fading;
the dawn takes her away.
I cannot keep her alive,
she has over stepped her stay.
She'll be gone soon
taking some other form;
like chaos and matter.
I can only hope
that the horizon holds
her paradise
at last.
