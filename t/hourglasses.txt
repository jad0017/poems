Years apart; parallel they stand.
Resolute glasses filled with sand.

Decades before when these sands were new,
Long sundered but closer they grew.

Timeless, they thought, though grains still fell.
The moment had passed, not all was well.

Unrest took hold; another glass was found.
The older left for the shiny and round.

Hours are short, yet feel so long.
Emotions are cruel; the love had not gone.

Decades after, they met once more.
Together forever, this time, they swore.

One glass was taken gripped by Death hand.
The other, dusty and broken, alone, still stands.
