It was another normal night.
The house was quiet and still.
There was nothing to fear.
I was safe behind those walls.

The twilight tranquility
Sublimeness of sleep
I thought would last forever
But forever can be bleak.

From darkness it came
Amorphous figure of black.

Faceless It took my hand.
Faceless It leaned and whispered to me
Austere, hollow, and grave.

Back into darkness it went
Amorphous figure of black.

Faceless It cursed my life.
Faceless It told me tales that lingered
Austere, hollow, and grave.

It was another normal night.
The house was cadaverously still.
There was everything to fear
In that suffocated reality.
