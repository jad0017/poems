He, of ivory throne,
with diabolical cries,
screams of silence
with hysterical eyes.

the whispers keep breathing

Where the spinner in darkness
haunts the abyss,
drink from the chalice
a dark-red kiss.

Deep in the woods where the widows prey
Five candles are set upon a floor of clay.
Shadows are cast on that pentacle star.
The mad king whispers

Twice invoked on oblique lines;
space contorts to open the skies.
He who hunts, who eats insanity,
a fiend of night who dreams reality,
enters the world to spread calamity.

The whispers have stopped.
Now the robe may sleep
while The Elder rides
and the living weep.
