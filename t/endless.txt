My home unfamiliar
where she still lingers
a pantheon by stricken times

I long for the life
that has learned to die
as the cadaverous voice
calls my name

that reaper leave me
haunted by her soul

hope runs dry
as I struggle to decay

May death
come dressed in robes
of countless lives
to take me away
to my forlorn bride
