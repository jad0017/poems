Fragile and outnumbered,
Your iron shroud showed them Hell.
But to you,
You met the haze.
You forsook the grave
To wallow in the dark
And beg the mire for Fall elegy.
The cold cut your search.
But grace left you blind
And to believe
That you'll one day see the sky.
Softly It's already your fault
Aches the ethereal in devastation.
In rope, by circumstance, you found
An ill-shaped friend.
Fear faltered and drowned you. But,
There was a catch.
Your friend wished to show you rapture
Your salvation.
But it stretched too thin;
No afflicted mercy awaited you.
Unresolute, your tears
Salted your lips.
Yet they bred your lust for holiness.
They birthed your unrelention.
You found the crown
Made from thorns
And promised
As you bled
To remove your horns.
Still, the dark,
The ice,
The mist,
And the snow,
Made sure that
You would finally go.
You, who collected tounges.
You, draconian and misanthropic,
Found escape to redemption at last,
But could not run from your radiant
Blood-filled past.
The ethereal took you to judge.
The ethereal ruled your blackness.
The ethereal showed you light.
The ethereal laughed as you petrified.
Fragile and outnumbered,
Your iron shroud showed them Hell.
And for each of those bloodied leaves
Your body was broken
As the ethereal judged your deeds
And showed you Hell
Just as you showed those leaves.
