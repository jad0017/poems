These eyes were once removed from malice.
In time they learned alongside deceit.
Enthralled before by blackened silk
happiness became bereft of me.

Sundered by lust
of sociopathic play,
an endless mourning of purgated promise
putrefied and devoured
by incantatory edge,

Brazened, now, in shame of phantom transparency,
languid in virtue
enshrouded in grim remembrance
of azure landscapes
veiled in the pale moon glow.

Implacable, I've become,
consumed by warm memory,
set ablaze by beguiled ivory,
fervent in pursuit
of incandescent seas,
slowed only by brackish somnolence
entombing this monstrosity
of besotted dread.

Tormented with irremediable unrest,
this dissonant vortex
of brocaded lucidity,
bodes to wither me
to listless delirium,
incapable to escape my eternal bed.
