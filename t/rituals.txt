Brooding clouds set upon the early morning sky
a lethargic breath of hideous Autumn.
Sleepless, again, I find myself here.
A very singular existence,
affront a very singular cafe.

The scenery never changes;
Rustic and monochromatic brown.
Faded tables and floors,
Faded chairs and rails,
A weary landscape distorting time.

In the corner,
An ancient roaster relentlessly burns
Arabica beans a miserable chugging
that unnerves the silence.
Someday the owner will quell that suffering

I stand where I've stood many before,
and speak what I've spoken all too often.
An exchange made over the still clean counter,
for the voluptuous blend of Sumatran and Guatemalan,
the barista refers, only to, as Black Velvet,
and I, a corporeal delight.
