Earth removes her feathered hat;
slowly undressing the landscape until
all falls barren.

vibrance gone;
trembling the womb that birthed
the trees the corn and the leaves.

Sixteen times the leaves had turned
and the beauty exposed.

Sixteen times I saw that scene.
Sixteen times forced to remember
the stricken face of her
dying body.
