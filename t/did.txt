Evil is never so obvious
as others may lead you to believe.

I first met the devil
long ago on some winter eve,
or was it before
when the leaves began to fall?

Regardless, the encounter was
a marvelous sight.

The jitters I felt
still keep me well into the night.

Beautiful, was she, with lovely brown hair,
an adorable chin
endearing eyes
and a playful grin.

She spoke softly with a voice
that might purify the damned,
but now I know all she spoke were lies.

At the time, all seemed right in the world.

Together we visited a garden
known only to few.

A secret haven where
the blood flowers once grew.

The hours were long, but still they fled.
So, relaxed, aside a tree, I laid my head.

I closed my eyes
and let the cool breeze envelope me
in a languid tranquility.

and when I awoke,
well,
I found a knife against my throat.

She laughed it off
with eyes filled with glee.
Surely I must have more sense than to stay,
though at the time,
I don't know that I cared.

I was entranced by that temptress
whose skin was smooth and fair
whose speech was a ballad sung only for me.

My heart was caged and she held the key.

Again, one day, I had felt at ease
as the sun began to set,
she whispered in my ear
a serenade to sleep.

This time, I awoke with screams
to a sharp pain deep in my chest
with my adored smiling over me
and nails protruding from my barren flesh.

The fog had cleared,
as I cried in agony.

That Eldritch whore
seemed eager to pierce me more.

Terrified, I ran to prevent my tragedy.

I fled the region,
for all that I dread
might someday find
and wish me dead.
