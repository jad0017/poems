This is the field where fleas come to die.

They come and I catch them.
I tie them up there
there with the ropes and the shackles.

I pluck off their legs one by one
into perfect symmetry.

I slice their backs right down the middle
and peel aside the lateral flaps.

So slowly
So carefully

I wouldn't want to tear them.

I clear out the insides
get those bits out of the way.
Just a few scoops.

I stuff the shells all full of corn
and sew them up tight.
Stitch stitch stitch

I dress them in green
and straighten their ties.

I line them there one by one
in neat little rows
all in a maze.

It's almost ready;
Just three more days.

I'll open up shop
to lure more children for crop
for the next grand attraction
in my graveyard of fleas.
