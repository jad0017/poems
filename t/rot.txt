Take me to the wilderness
where the stumps rot
with teeth and the
sap runs red.

Take me to the wilderness
where the tongues fall
in Autumn and the
ground tastes of shit and piss.

Take me to the wilderness
where the trees don
fallen flesh and the
roots grow nails into the Earth.

Take me to the wilderness
to that monument of putrid life;
to where I want to burn.

Since I can no longer control myself,
set ablaze the festered skin
and lay me to rest
before I kill again.
