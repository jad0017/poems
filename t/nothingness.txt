I found you in the nothingness
Broken and beaten and scarred.
The thorns about your soul

I took you in my arms
Tearing my flesh from bone
To welcome you to darkness;
The place I call my home.

You took me in your arms,
Adorning yourself with lies.
You welcomed me to darkness;
That place between your thighs.

You found me in the nothingness
Another heart for you to take
But all I have is emptiness
For this heart of mine is fake.

You fed me with your madness.
You let me trust your voice.
You tried to take my heart
But in your blood, I rejoice.

I stabbed you into nothingness.
I sundered you from bone.
I ate your sullied flesh.
And now I'm all alone.
