You go about your day,
doing everything the same,
but while you're talking
your mind goes blank.
Your lungs forget to breath.
You can barely register your heart beating.

You are not even sure if it is real
or if that periodic feeling in your chest
is just another dull sound your ears are perceiving.

Then your lungs remember to breath.
and your eyes remember to track
and the sound all comes rushing back.

And you just pick up where you left off
hoping that no one noticed the pause
The lack of expression
The glossed over eyes

But they do.

Because the pause was a little too long
and your expression was full of pain
and your eyes were not glossy,
they were struggling to roll up into your skull.

And they always ask, are you okay?
It's clear that you can't say yes

Can't they just let it go?

There is no cure except to sleep
and telling you so won't make it come any easier.

There is just too much pain.
Too much emptiness
when, every day,
even if just for a few moments,
you forget that you are alive.
