People are weird.
You can't trust what they will say.

you will sit in a bar,
or class,
or even my car,
and you will hear shit.

they will swear it all makes sense;
That you are just out of context.

But you will hear them clear and oddly pronounced
that they will leave a breadcrumb trail of condoms for their spouse.

Or they could be more vague
like James who probably abstains,
since he insists that his dick is not
a sprinkler slinging sperm
all over a field of drunken grass.

Yes, people are weird.
they will say anything these days.

Because you really need a side chick
for when your main is being a bitch.

And never wear shorts when you are in an ally sucking dick.
Because you will get caught in the moment and never want to quit.
And the marginal padding provided by pants will really help your knees.

And, you know, while you are at it,
stop being afraid of fucking bees.

Your knees are fucked up
and you worry about bees?

The fuck is wrong with you? Jeez.
People are weird.
