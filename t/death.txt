this is the desert which swallows all hope.
Open the window; breathe the stale air.
You've already lost; there's no one to care.
Find the spire and bring a rope.
Fall It's a long way down.
Fall you'll miss the ground.
See the people; feel their hate.
These are the ones that sealed your fate.

The desert does not end.
Walk you will wander forever--
and forget your stupid endeavor.
Burn curse the sun.
Your sanity will bend.
Incinerate this world; ease your pain.
Take the knife; what's not to gain?
Let the blade fall; rest now against the wall.

Listen to my voice: you still have a choice.

The endless desert hides a door;
the only refuge from this constant war.
The door is locked with hope its key.
Find it and set us free.
