This dragon was once in love.

I saw her grazing
and pooping everywhere

A majestic unicorn
with baby blue hair.

Her mane was fluffy;
it made my heart pound
and the air all stuffy.

One day she caught me staring.

I panicked.
Are you a piece of toast?
Because I want to spread
my butter all over you.

The air froze
and my heart skipped a beat
when she opened her mouth
and snapped,
I'm not a tooth fairy.
I will not suffer fools.
What does a fat dragon
like you know about
letting a unicorn trot first?

My spirit was crushed
and my wings turned to lead.

She galloped off
and left me behind.
But I just couldn't get her
thought out of my head:

Legs for days
and a tail that sways and sways.

I saw her again a month later.

She was prancing all around
leaving little hoof prints on the ground.

So I puffed up my chest
until my cheeks turned blue
and I strolled over
with my head held high.

Let me cut to the chase,
I said without any tact nor grace,
I want taco on a date with you.

But she wouldn't give me a chance.
You call that an approach?
Don't make me laugh.
You're just gross.
You'll never get me.
You'll always fail;
especially with that small of a tail.

I stood there speechless
Is my tail really too small?
Maybe Natural Tail Enhancement would help?
No It's over.
If I don't stop
I'll just suffer
as another victim
of the Bad Pony Club.
