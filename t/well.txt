Black everything black.
To the concrete beneath my feet
To these walls
These claustrophobic walls build upon lies.
And then that hourglass
that silver hourglass
on which the demons dance
and the sand falls red.

That elder hag she put me here.
Why, obediently, did I partake
Of that cretin stew?

A light there's a light in here
Closer and closer peering in front
Of decaying skin and ebony eyes.
Crouching, disheveled and doleful.
Staring just staring at me.

We are one; it and I.
We differ by skin and of cloth,
But our bones are one
and out eyes speak the same.

Turning it hobbles.
I follow close.
The fungi covering the cavity
Squelch each step I take.

On and on it hobbles,
Further and further,
Faster than I,
Until it turns out of sight.
The light is a distant memory, but still
Still I continue in the black.

I miss step in the dark.
My feet meet an edge.

With my senses dulled
I respond too late.

The greeting is over
and this fall my fate.
