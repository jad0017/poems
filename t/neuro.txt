You've done it You've taken my goals.
I'm caught in a landslide like so many souls.
Who, left, is there for me to confide?

I searched for answers in your face.
But all I found was a sullen place
filled with guilt and misery.

I have lost my best friend,
but this pain too will end.

I still find myself in old reverie

In your wake, I refuse to drown.
Forget it, Jake, It's Chinatown.
