Floating indiscernible fragments
drifting across the ethereal plain

the fragments collide
into tangled constructions
of corporeal thought

where dread attaches as fear forgets

the mirrors always watch
the doors never remain locked

opening fading from the astral
the stellar fields

where the body persists asleep with the stars

floating indiscernible fragments
drifting away from the calumnies of reality

the fragments collide
into tangled constructions

where a whisper is a scream
where the doors are always open
where the mirrors never sleep

where the heard never
the heart never
truly beats
