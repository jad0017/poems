Rich Sessile and Pedunculate Oak,
Charred to a toasty burnt umber.
Locked together, three years in that cellar,
Where malted barley lingers.
Long awaited that barrel was pulled
Vanillin, smoked, and spiced
Spilled from that lid,
A deep roasted carmine.
Decanted filled to the brim.
Heathered and dignified
In a glass of fogged mahogany.
A perfectly balanced Scotch,
Softly drowning two stones.
