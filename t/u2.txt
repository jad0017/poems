Behind the tide,
Through the Ancients,
You found today
To be almost withered
While the blue erases
Me.
The desert soul,
Where your emotions morn
What the tounge laid
Into the newborn divide,
Search, sleepless, for
Calumnies.
Victory through words.
Conquer, ablaze with
Adoration but summon coldness
Everywhere you turn.
You are wedded downward;
Ever-held to roam
By the suit you killed.
You collapsed one day.
In the Summer,
You held, somehow, the pain.
But you came undone
As the cross came greater.
Your concious tracked weary in shame.
And you carried the strife that blisted your veins
Until the end;
Unto your grave.
