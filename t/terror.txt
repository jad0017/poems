The apricot sky
looks down upon me.

Laughing as the shadows
move and encircle
their prey.

The street lamp light
caresses me consoling
but it wont last.

The power will cut.
The birds will gawk.
The dogs will hunt.
And the blackness
the imperceptible
will be within reach.

These things should be nightmares
but I'm not asleep.

Those shades without eyes
without ears
without form
will find me

here by this lamp post.
Certainly this will be my grave.

Entombed along a leisurely stroll
back to my home.

I shouldn't have stayed out so late.
I'm not prepared to die.

But there's no where to run.
I'm stuck  I'm done.

I'll just lay down and cry
until the shades take me away.

Goodbye.
