A journey cast on cobbled stone\ldots \\
A purpose set in casks of bones\ldots \\
Sam swept across the muddy snow, \\
propelled along by dust light \\
from a lantern wound with webs of flies. \\
Canopies grew as Sam pushed on \\
until his foot met a log. \\
The cradle lay to his right. \\
A home for maggots, mites, and worms\ldots \\
Sam took and held that rotting wood--- \\
that wriggling mass of child-cries--- \\
while the flaming ghost by his side \\
wisped and flicked. \\
\\
Sam \\
was seven. \\
It \\
was the biggest box under the tree. \\
He \\
was so excited \\
as he slowly removed the bright red bow, \\
folding it into this perfect satin pile \\
before tearing off the shiny \\
green wrapping paper reflecting the smile in his eyes. \\
It \\
was perfect. \\
More perfect than the neatly piled satin ribbon\ldots \\
More perfect than the billowy white mounds of unbroken \\
possibilities that lay just beyond the window panes. \\
Sam ran to his room, \\
donned his sheriffs hat and holstered plastic pistol, \\
lifted the wooden pole with the \ldots \ldots \\
and galloped out into the icy deserts.
\\
\\
They led him through \\
the remnants held \\
in nature's grasp: \\
The rusted stories and mossy past \\
that strayed Sam from his path: \\
The trenches worn in wine-stained floors\ldots \\
The weathered pawns with rage-cracked heads\ldots \\
\\
Sam preferred the tales to \\
his waking fantasies. \\
\\
Sam preferred \\
the tales told by fallen snow \\
than those artifices \\
of these waking fantasies...
