It was a journey cast on cobbled stone\ldots \\
a purpuse set within his bones\ldots \\
Sam swept across the muddy snow, \\
propelled along by dusty light \\
from a lantern wound with webs and flies. \\
\\
The canopies grew and faded \\
as Sam pushed on. \\
\\
Miles in \\
his foot \\
met a log. \\
\\
This cradle \\
lay to his right--- \\
a home for worms, \\
maggots, and mites. \\
\\
Sam took and held that rotting wood--- \\
That wriggling mass of child-cries--- \\
while the flaming ghost \
by his side \
wisped and flecked \\
in the windless night. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}Sam was seven. \\
\hspace*{2ex}It was the biggest box under the tree. \\
\hspace*{2ex}He was so excited \\
\hspace*{2ex}as he slowly removed the bright red bow, \\
\hspace*{2ex}folding it into this perfect satin pile \\
\hspace*{2ex}before tearing off the shiny green \\
\hspace*{2ex}wrapping paper reflecting the smile in his eyes. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}It was perfect. \\
\hspace*{2ex}More perfect than the neatly piled satin ribbon\ldots \\
\hspace*{2ex}More perfect than the billowy white mounds of unbroken \\
\hspace*{2ex}possibilities that lay just beyond the window panes. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}Sam ran to his room, \\
\hspace*{2ex}donned his the sheriff's hat and holstered plastic pistol. \\
\hspace*{2ex}He lifted hobby horse from from its box \\
\hspace*{2ex}and galloped out into the icy West. \\
\\
The stump hit the ground, \\
as the flaming ghost led him through \\
the remnants held \\
in nature's grasp: \\
\\
The rotting stories and mossy past \\
that strayed Sam from his path\ldots \\

He sat along a brush-buried bike (that) \\
red vines had claimed as their own. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}Sam was fourteen. \\
\hspace*{2ex}The horse had been replaced by a clarinet \\
\hspace*{2ex}with a long slinder shaft with odd bits and nobs \\
\hspace*{2ex}that reminded Sam of the old wooden pole \\
\hspace*{2ex}with the dirt-beat mane and missing eye. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}Same practiced and practiced until \\
\hspace*{2ex}his lungs grew a sound of their own. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}But his new love didn't last. \\
\\
\hspace*{2ex}At eighteen Sam moved out. \\
\hspace*{2ex}Bills had to be paid \\
\hspace*{2ex}and the clarinet put away. \\
\\
The forest forgave \\
as the ghost burned out \\
the trenches worn in wine-stained floors, \\
the weathered pawns with rage-cracked heads, \\
the tales told by fallen snow\ldots \\
\\
Sam's waking fantasies \\
won't haunt him anymore. \\
