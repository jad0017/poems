% the devil has his way
% /and that's not okay/
% so I devised a simple method

% It was 1879 -- Plain Facts for Old and Young

When you're \\
choking the chicken at home alone \\
the devil has his way \\
and that's why we say \\
make sure you eat \\
a balanced breakfast every day. \\
For you see \\
it is but science \\
and plainess \\
that a healthy diet \\
and regular enemas \\
keep you pure. \\
\\

\\
If you catch your boy \\
with his sausage in hand \\
do just as I say \\
take him in to cut the skin \\
without any anesthesia. \\
The slight tingle of the operation \\
will serve as a soothing deterent \\
to never stain his hands again. \\
We have verified the results \\
of this proceedure \\
with significant satisfaction \\
from over a hundred trials \\
conducted at the sanitarium. \\
\\
In summary: \\
Don't hold ya' meat \\
and don't flick the bean; \\
instead grab a spoon. \\
Get a bowl! \\
And get some flakes! \\
They're all you'll ever need \\
to stay sin free. \\
\\
That's the Kellogg's Guarantee. \\
