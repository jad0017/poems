{\footnotesize\textbf{For My Love, Thy Darkness Abound}} \\
\\
Your thirteen lights of coven \\
rose above the ocean throne. \\
Your scrying eyes were searching \\
for a Lilith in repose \\
but instead all they found \\
was a sorry mass dirt and bones. \\
\\
``What is your wish?'', you asked \\
as you shook my limbs and peered \\
into my dark. \\
\\
\textit{No mourning for my soul,} \\
\textit{now that it sits among the clouds} \\
\textit{and my body communes} \\
\textit{with the shallow tides slipping}\\
\textit{from the bleak physique of your shroud,} \\
\textit{fragile, as my eons leak} \\
\textit{into your pariah's tomb.} \\
\\
%You regurgitate the chunks of my hear, \\
%each piece baring tiny cyclic marks \\
%from where you tore it from my corspe. \\
%
% They are at home drifting in your bile \\
% and embraced by your hooves \\
In the dark, unforgiving, \\
a bittersweet ode-to-be, \\
intertwined as we dance \\
anxiously waiting \\
to shed our selves. \\
\\
``What is your wish?'', you asked. \\
\\
That the hollow die alone \\
in a heap \\
with their unused parts here \\
in the temple of the moon \\
never sacrificed, but always doomed. \\
\\
It's cold inside my shell \\
burning all my laurels \\
for another glimps of satisfied suffering \\
as I pull and I pull at my belly button string \\
trying to unwind the knots in my stomach \\
and bearing the fear that they bring. \\
But no one ever told me \\
butterflies appear in pairs. \\
\\
``Can't you walk among the stars? \\
Can't you follow their trails?'' \\
