After (the) long Knights' Con-test, \\
I started on this weary quest \\
With fate to guide my way. \\
\\ % v Should this stanza be in past-tense? Yes!
%Now this mountain's path I take \\ % XXX
%each monster bodes my soul to break \\ % meh XXX
%And I to pass away. \\ % XXX
%But yet I never pass away. \\
%I took the windy mountain pass \\
%(and) the monsters came all too fast \\ % brasse? tasse? grass? last? XXX
%But I never turned away. \\
Four days I climbed and waged a war, \\
Through Claw and Steel and endless gore, \\
Upon the windy mountain pass, \\
Until I found the cave at last. \\
%% Four days I climbed and waged a war \\
%% Through Claw and Steel I acked for more \\
%I grew weak but they wanted more \\
% gore, more, boar, roar, door, floor, core?
\\
I laid my head by the smoldered stone \\
when I heard the monster stir and groan \\
% I was forced by fear to pray.
% Climb walls?
% Enter Cavern?
% Talk about how much of a monster the dragon is?
% Resoundance to die?
