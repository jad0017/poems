\textbf{...} \\
\\
After (the) long Knights' Con-test, \\
I started on this weary quest \\
With fate to guide my way. \\
\\
Four days I climbed and wages a war \\
Through Claw and Steel and Endless Gore, \\
Upon the windy Mountain Pass, \\
Until I found the cave at last. \\
\\
I laid my head by (the) Smoldered Stone \\
When I heard the Monster stir and groan \\
And fear took hold (of) my chest. \\
\\
I snuck through the cavern--- \\
My sword held high--- \\
To slay that Wyvern, \\
Lest I die. \\
\\
The wyrm slept strong \\
Atop its gold \\
and I knelt down to pray. \\
\\
``Lord protect me on this day \\
From this dange-rous beast. \\
I abate my fear. \\
I must be bold \\
to revenge my fallen friends.'' \\
\\
I plunged my sword in too deep. \\
The dragon woke and bared its teeth \\
As I slowly backed away. \\
\\
The Wyrm released a mighty roar, \\
a puff of smoke, and sneezed. \\
\\
The fearful blow knocked me down \\
And the dragon stepped on me. \\
\\
My life was gone. \\
My tale was done. \\
``May God save the [King]\ldots{}'' \\
