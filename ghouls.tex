Shadows dance and slither into trees \\
\hh as our moon laughs wickedly. \\
You think us mad, always hiding from the sun, \\
\hh but it's our choice not our hearse, yet you keep \\
\hh handing us the gun. \\
We uncover ourselves in the darkest light. \\
\h Atune your eyes, gaze at our plight. \\ % Bleh
There are no guises here, what of us do you fear? \\ % Bleh
Your ideals spill out, dispersed, like a breath of wind \\
\hh so we bundle up and build our walls; we never liked the breeze \\
\hh still we'd rather freeze within crepuscular dignity. \\ % without crepuscular indignity?
%----
%Six legs sprout from the floor.
%The tell-tale web covers everything they touch
%\hh in never-ending entaglement
%Better start now, untangling the lies,
%\hh it's gonna take some time.
