\\
My home: unfamiliar. \\
Where she still lingers: \\
A pantheon by stricken times. \\
\\
I long for the life \\
that has learned to die. \\
As the cadaverous voice \\
calls my name. \\
\\
%The solitary reaper \\
%has left me \\
That reaper leaves me \\
haunted by her soul. \\
\\
Hope runs dry \\
as I struggle to decay. \\
\\
May Death \\
come, dressed in robes \\
of countless lives, \\
to take me away \\
to my forlorn bride. \\
